    "text": "<p>A Cautionary Advice To A Young Friend</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>17+ The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us the aged have for friends some young men and women. Occasionally we meet and interact, and we tell one another “What was and &nbsp;what is!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generations differ no one doubts this, however, some principles don’t change with generational change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rate at which societal values are changing has been a source of worry and concern to the older generation! In a conversation with a young friend, this issue came up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The conclusion we both came up with was “ somebody ( a generation) went to sleep” A generation failed to uphold and pass on to the other what it received. It is this failure that has brought us to where we are today! The question was How do we then reset the clock?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see and experience these in every sphere of life be it social, church, family or national. Had the failed generation followed the principle of transferring to others what it received we would have maintain high moral and ethical standards and sanity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the Church we have kept and observe the Lord’s Supper because, as Paul said ;&nbsp;</p><p>Corinthians 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have passed on to us values that have kept past generations sound, united, responsive and respectful. Today all these have crumbled before our very eyes. This is a laissez-faire generation!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sages of old have always held as sacrosanct this commandment;</p><p>Proverbs 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>8+ My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</p><p>2+ Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do we see today?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, the “old order changeth”, but eternal laws/principles, truths etc remain the same. These are what is called the “ eternal non-negotiable principles and laws”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of which is respect for the elderly, in whom reside refined quality thought, wisdom and common sense as a result of experience gathered through life!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If only we could all pay attention to this warning, our journey would be smooth and end well! &nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 20</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every generation was once a youthful generation, blessed are those who recognize that progress and success lie in the degree and extent to which they treat those who were before them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything is an inheritance, a transference from one generation to the other. What have you inherited? And from whom? Your deeds etc will reveal what you inherited and from whom!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eyes are watching l!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The contents of a wicked heart are seen through deeds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a heart that conceives, plans and executes evil as if it were for fun! A wicked heart is a heart that rejoices and stands aloof when others suffer. It is self-centred.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also a heart full of vengeance, that knows no forgiveness unless he has paid back evil with evil. It is a vindictive heart!

Very skillful in their choices of words either spoken or written. It is always a delight to hear them speak or read what they write</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To speak therefore is the same as to write with a pen, &nbsp;one is audible the other silent, they all have the same audience!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Words spoken or written can be classified into two categories: wise and unwise. They can make or break the spirit of their hearers or readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore heed this admonition;&nbsp;<br>Proverbs 25<br>KJV<br>11+ A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p><p>Proverbs 15:23&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[23] A person finds joy in giving an apt reply---and how good is a <strong>timely word</strong>!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Timely words </strong>are very important, read how Isaiah puts it ; &nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 50<br>KJV<br>4+ The Lord God hath given me the <strong>tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season</strong> to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.<br><br>Words whether spoken or written live forever in the minds of both hearers and readers. Their effects may be forgiven or forgotten but not the words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a practical note, I’ve had many referring me to things I’ve said or written before. Some in context others taken out of context!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to note that the words we speak or write will be recalled on the Day of Judgment as testimonies for or against us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 12<br>KJV<br>36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p><p>37+ For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p><p>James also warned ;&nbsp;</p><p><br>James 3:1-2&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[1] Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.</p><p>[2] We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, beloved choose your words, do your best to let them be appropriate and relevant to the occasion. Be measured and economical in the use of words; either spoken or written.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tongue is a pen, use it wisely! In writing we think through before we put any word on paper, in like manner train your tongue to weigh words before they are uttered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The careless use of words has caused many a relationship, either friendship or marriage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe</p>",

    "text": "<p><br>Acts 1<br>KJV<br>11+ Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was said many centuries ago and has remained the main hope and expectation of all believers!&nbsp;<br>Can it truly be said that we await with preparation and expectation, &nbsp;His second coming? &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When was the last time you heard a sermon on The Second Coming? It has been assumed and therefore pushed to the back burner. This explains why the faith of many has grown cold because they’ve lost appetite for heaven. Hmmm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rereading these scriptures brought to mind the famous statement often heard at the end of every Fu Manchu film series from the lips of popular actor Christopher Lee, aka Fu Manchu!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our youth (1960/70) we watched a series of films depicting a notorious underworld figure called Fu Manchu. Though at the end of every series he would be caught, yet before the film is brought to a close he would appear and utter the words “ the world shall hear of me again”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As naive as we then were, this statement from Fu Manchu frightens us because we see him appear in another episode; we often wonder how he could reappear after his death! Truly, It is great to be young!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reading what the angel told the disciples should remind us that &nbsp;“&nbsp;<br>this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This means Jesus will return in a physical form and not as a spirit as some claim and will be seen by all! What is unknown is the when! The ‘how’ we know, the ‘where He will come from’ &nbsp;we know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you thought about this? On that day a great mystery shall be solved as we shall see Him as He is! Whether white, black, yellow-skinned etc we don’t know. That day and hour shall declare! Truly we look forward to that day and His appearance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, since we don’t know the “when” let each be always ready so His return does not take him/her unaware. The question that should be of great concern &nbsp;is where will He find us? In what state or condition? Peaceful or angry, loving or hating? Etc. Think about this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This question worried Fanny J Crosby (1820-1915) &nbsp;a blind songwriter which led her to write this hymn ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jesus comes to reward His servants,<br>Whether it be noon or night,<br>Faithful to Him will He find us watching,<br>With our lamps all trimmed and bright?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Oh, can we say we are ready, brother?<br>Ready for the soul’s bright home?<br>Say, will He find you and me still watching,<br>Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2<br>If at the dawn of the early morning,<br>He shall call us one by one,<br>When to the Lord we restore our talents,<br>Will He answer thee—Well done?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3<br>Have we been true to the trust He left us?<br>Do we seek to do our best?<br>If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,<br>We shall have a glorious rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4<br>Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching,<br>In His glory they shall share;<br>If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,<br>Will He find us watching there?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How do we answer these questions?

    "text": "(series 5) <br>3 John 1<br>KJV<br>3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou <b>walkest in the truth</b>.<br>4+ I have no greater joy than to hear that my children <b>walk in truth.</b><br><br>Life’s lessons are taught by following a systematically arranged curriculum or through experience. There is “ systematic truth “ and “ experiential Truth”. <br><br>The pursuit of both is recommended and desirable, but the experiential is the most preferred. An effective, useful, and successful person possesses the combination of both classroom and street ( experiential) sense! <br><br>As the psalmist requested, truth must be taught ; <br>Psalms 86<br>KJV<br>11+ Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.<br><br>In the case of Christianity, an effective useful child of God is the one who not only knows the scriptures ( theoretical) but can apply them in the real world   It is not about “ quotation “ it is about “ application”. <br><br>Two things are highlighted in the above scripture passages, “to walk in the truth” and “to walk in truth”. The two statements are not the same. <br><br>The first presupposes that there is a body of knowledge called “ the truth “  which one must uphold and apply to be described as “ walking in the truth”<br><br>To live and do things as stated in the scriptures is to “ walk in <b>the</b> truth as scripture is the Truth <br>John 17<br>KJV<br>17+ Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<br><br>The question we  must ask ourselves daily is “Are we walking in <b>the truth</b>?”  Are we living lives that are consistent and in conformity with <b>the Truth</b>?” The Word.   <br><br>The second thought conveyed in the verses above is “ walking <b>in truth</b>” To walk In Truth is simply to be sincere, honest, to be a promise keeper, reliable, trustworthy, your word is your bond. One word sums it up “ principled”. <br><br>To walk in the teeth gladdens the heart of God and fellow man. The Apostle John could not hide his joy when he saw and experienced the life of the children of a Christian sister. <br><br>2 John 1<br>KJV<br>4+ I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.<br><br>When the knowledge of the Word of God influences us it makes us walk in truth. We deal sincerely and honestly with people as we live principled lives. <br><br>Interestingly, it is only fellow principled people who see this and admire the principled. The unprincipled finds it difficult to understand let alone accept them! <br><br>Yes, darkness and light can not coexist. The vulgar, rude, uncouth etc can not coexist with the disciplined, decent-minded, orderly etc. We see these every day as we relate to people. <br><br>Ever wondered why some disliked, speak evil of you, why your presence in their midst disturbs them etc? It is because you Walk In Truth. You call a spade a spade and not a shovel  You are principled! <br><br>Read God’s promise to the principled, those who walk in truth ; <br>1 Kings 2<br>KJV<br>4+ That the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, <b>If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth</b> with all their <b>heart</b> and with all their <b>soul</b>, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.<br><br>Beloved, teach yourself how to walk not only in <b>the</b> truth but also <b>in</b> truth!<br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe",

It was a night to remember! <br><br>The program was arranged such that Wilson Pickett was to appear on stage exactly at midnight; which he did wearing a black slack with silver buttons that flashed dazzlingly. Guess what, he came on stage as the hour struck midnight with his evergreen song “ Midnight Hour!“ <br><br>The crowd yelled and surged forward  as he spoke the first words of the song “ Am gonna wait till the midnight hour”. And he did! It was a scene best seen/experienced rather than told/described. That was Ghana then! <br><br>Beloved, the mistakes many have made ( and are still making) in life can be attributed to the exercise of poor judgment. Like Lot, many have allowed the “ green grass “to fool them. As the scriptures said,<br> “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where,”. Lot was undiscerning! He did what is described today as “ failure to read between the lines”. <br><br>Oh, how many an undiscerning youth have lifted their eyes and beheld all the fake, pretentious lives  of glamour that celebrities portray  on tv and other social media handles ,  and thought they are real. Only to be disappointed with the passage of time. <br><br>Yes, do not let the fake green grass fool you. In use in Ghana today is an imitated synthetic made  “green grass” used mostly to decorate event grounds.  <br><br>For a natural “green grass” to last long and not die/dry easily the soil must be well prepared, which activity takes time. It also requires regular maintenance . Beloved, for a success to last long, it would require  a deliberate, conscious effort and  preparation .  One must be willing to invest, work hard  and wait patiently. <br><br>There are many today who are in life’s scrap yard , gnashing their teeth because they were fooled by the “ green grass” ! <br><br>Scripture is true, read a few ; <br>Proverbs 13<br>KJV<br>11+ Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.<br><br>Proverbs 20<br>KJV<br>21+ An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.<br><br>Proverbs 28<br>KJV<br>20+ A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.<br><br>Proverbs 28<br>KJV<br>22+ He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.<br><br>The grass is not green everywhere, therefore be discerning ! Like , Lot don’t let the green grass fool you. <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Luke 24<br>KJV<br>7+ Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br><br>Unlike political candidates who say many things but are unable to fulfil them, all that Jesus said about himself, and what He will do or be done to Him were all fulfilled. He was an amazing Man of His Words who must be taken seriously. <br><br>One such prediction is what you’ve read;  that He will be betrayed, condemned and crucified and on the third day shall rise again. <br><br>When He first said these many were those who doubted Him, made mockery and ridiculed  Him, but it came to pass. <br><br>In the early hours of the First Day of the week, the city of Jerusalem woke up to “ breaking news ! ”. <br><br>Three women on a fact-finding mission to the cemetery where He was buried met with an empty tomb. They hurried back to town to gossip their findings to a few. They gossiped because they were afraid. <br><br>But as is normal with gossip no sooner had they whispered this to a few than it became news that went viral. <br><br>Reporters and stringers from the Jerusalem Chronicle, Jerusalem FM John 3:16,  Pilate FM, Matthew 27:24 and sister stations within and outside the city met with these women and interviewed them live on air. <br><br>They described vividly what they saw, the rolled stone, the empty tomb, and the man dressed in white who spoke to them. <br><br>They even repeated word for word what the white-clothed man said “Why seek ye the living among the dead? He has risen “<br><br>Yes, this is the Man Jesus. One newspaper headlined the morning’s publication with the words  “ He said it, and He did It!” The curious nature of the headline made the paper sold fast that by noon it has sold over several thousands. <br><br>Yes without a doubt , that Jesus died , was buried and on the third day rose again from the dead is an undeniable historical fact <br><br>We worship a risen Saviour. Upon the first day of the week as we assemble to break bread and drink of the cup let our voices and hearts rejoice   And may we do it from sincere , pure and honest hearts. <br><br>And., remember he who eat and drink in an unworthy manner, ( wicked , evil , unrepentant heart) eats and drinks damnation unto himself. <br><br>Maranatha <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Before then many have lived in anticipation of when this prophecy will come to pass. <br><br>Yes, “ thou will not leave my soul in Hell; neither wilt thou suffer Thine Holy One To see corruption “. <br>The final contest between the forces of Good and Evil, between Jesus and the Devil was that which began from His condemnation through his trial,  the crucifixion on the Cross, his burial and finally ended with His resurrection! <br><br>Yes, by His resurrection He put to shame the nay-sayers, those who out of envy condemned and crucified Him thinking they had finished Him!  <br><br>Yes, the same will be done to us who have pledged our loyalty to Him, our enemies, our doubters and naysayers shall humiliate and make a mockery of us! <br><br>Yes, beloved our enemies will bury us in disgrace, humiliation and dishonour! They will make our names a byword by soiling our image and reputation, but we shall rise to conquer in the end. <br><br>Just like how He rose from the dead even so shall we also rise from the depth of humiliation, disgrace and dishonor that our foes have buried us. We shall rise to fame and glory in the name of Jesus. Impossibilities shall become possible. <br><br>Yes, he who laughs last laughs best! It is the doings of the Lord, disgrace and dishonor can not keep us down;  in the Name of Jesus we shall pull down the “ bars of shame “. <br><br>A hymn writer put it this way “Death can not keep its prey, he tore the bars away, up from the grave he arose with a mighty triumph over his foes, he arose a Victor from the dark domain and for forever with His saints to reign! <br><br>Yes, Low in the grave He lay Jesus, my Savior!

    "text": "Ecclesiastes 3<br>KJV<br>22+ Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?<br><br>Ask again! “for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?” <br><br>It is easy to forget that this journey that we’ve embarked on here on Earth is a one-way journey. We came with only a one-way return ticket. We can not return to our homes once we leave. <br><br>Our visas are one-way visas and are not renewable when they expire though under certain circumstances they can be extended but not renewed. Visa extension is discretionary and is subject to conditions set by the Issuer! <br><br>What is of great worry and concern to all travellers here is the undisclosed nature of the visas, especially their expiry date. No one knows when, where and how his visa will expire. How long we stay is undisclosed! <br><br>Though many have tried to inquire,  investigate, speculate, propound theories etc; none has come out with any credible way of knowing when his/her visa will expire. <br><br>A hymn writer once said “Though men may search they can not find, for God alone does understand” Indeed the Issuer had stamped on the front page of our passport the following; <br><br>Deuteronomy 29:29 <br>NIV<br>[29] The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.<br><br>This was intended to warn us to desist from undertaking such inquiries and investigations! <br><br>This being the case how should we then spend our days/year’s etc.? <br><br>For the answers, we are privileged to have the memoirs of one person who knew this “one-way ticket “ phenomenon and spent his stay in a certain way so we shall consult him to know how we ought to spend ours! <br><br>There is a warning however, it is not everything he said he did that is recommended so read with care, caution and discernment! Readers are warned! <br><br>Before his visa expired he gave a brief expose of how he saw his stay, a frustrating and disappointing picture. Read it;<br><br>Ecclesiastes 2:18-24 <br>NIV<br>[18] I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. <br><br>[19] And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. <br><br>[20] So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. [21] For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.<br><br> [22] What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? [23] All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.<br><br>Hope was not lost to him, read what he did and hence his advice;  <br><br>[24] <b>A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God</b><br><br>To conclude take note of the following; we came with a one-way return ticket. We shall not come back again. Our visas are non-renewable, even if extended they shall surely expire. As to when we are unaware. We wish we could know how many years remain on our visas!  <br><br>Knowing this take his advice ; <br>Ecclesiastes 2:24 <br>NIV<br>[24] A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,<br><br>( Please do not “misread” or misinterpret  the word “drink” to mean go and “ chill” you are a Ghanaian I know you 🤣)<br><br>But on a more serious note be guided by his final advice <br><br>Ecclesiastes 11<br>KJV<br>9+ Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment<br><br>Ecclesiastes 12<br>KJV<br>13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<br><br>14+ For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.<br><br>A holiday reading I share with you! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Ephesians 4<br>KJV<br>25+ Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.<br><br>Zechariah 8<br>KJV<br>16+ These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:<br><br>One negative practice that appears to be gaining ground among professing believers is the art of lying. Yes, you read it. <br>Like you, I’ve also asked were we born liars or we learnt them? <br><br>The ease at which lies are told with a straight face makes one wonder if lying is part of our nature. Some say it is part of our “fallen nature” which is true! <br><br>But, surely we were not born liars we learnt them, it is a habit we acquire through association. If you grew up in a lying environment the chances of you becoming one is very high! . <br><br>If you work or associate yourself with liars the chances of you becoming one is very high. It is also evidentially clear that certain professions thrive on lies to succeed so if you should work in such environments/professions the chances of you becoming a liar are high. <br><br>Please note, that I am not implying one is automatically a liar, but the chances of becoming one are high! A conscious deliberate self-restraint is what one needs to stay true to oneself in such environments /professions <br><br>It is therefore a “disease” that we contract through association, so let us therefore watch our associations and walk away from any that have the potential of influencing us to become liars<br><br>“Researchers”  have found that Lie has sisters, these are “ sister rumour-monger”, “sister gossiper” “sister, hatred” and a younger “sister jealousy”  Some have given their mother’s name as “Madam Envy”! <br><br>They described her as a ferocious woman who does not take kindly to truth, hard work and progress anywhere by anyone,  she is feared worldwide. Read it;<br><br>Proverbs 27<br>KJV<br>4+ Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?<br><br>Who is able to stand before Mrs ( Mr) Envy? <br><br>Beloved, of great worry and concern, is how some have perfected this act of lying such that they are believed by even the wise! They know what to put together, how to present and say things, etc. <br><br>But why must someone lie? The reasons are many but the most important ones are,  fear, insecurity, low self-esteem, inadequacy, and the  craving for social acceptance and glorification   (You can add yours)<br><br>Beloved,  lies do not build, it rather destroy. It has been known to be the cause of breakdowns, and divisions among hitherto peaceful and loving relationships! <br><br>Dearly beloved if we can go by what the scriptures teach, we should not experience any such unpleasant situations; which is <br><br>Ephesians 4<br>KJV<br>25+ Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.<br><br>To lie is to betray a trust, and trust is the foundation on which relationships are built once betrayed everything crumbles! Many a once-strong relationship has crumbled as a result Of this act. <br><br>To put back the pieces ( trust ) is a Herculean task even if done it never looks the same as the original. So let us be careful about things we say to and about one another. <br><br>May we heed Paul’s admonition <br>Colossians 4<br>KJV<br>6+ Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.<br><br>May peace and truth be with and among us forever. Let us work towards achieving this! I desire to live in peace with you based on shared love and the truth we speak to each other. <br><br>My thoughts to share <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Matthew 5<br>KJV<br>20+ For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>In a recent conversation with a friend, this issue of how are we going to be assessed came up! I tried to avoid, evade, and abort it but to no avail !! I kept saying “Can we change the topic, conversation etc but he kept asking! So we sat down to discuss it in an informal manner <br><br>My attempt to avoid it is simple I don’t know. Though I said this several times it was such that I had to yield. So what you are about to read are views we both expressed and shared. <br><br>We began by asking is it possible that there would be a pass mark. A range! A cut-off point, etc? We both concluded that yes it is likely. We based our conclusion on the above passage. <br><br>It is a comparative passage “Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,”   The word “ except “ is the operative word suggesting that there is a baseline which must be crossed. <br><br>The “righteousness “ of the Scribes and Pharisees  was set as the baseline which must be crossed before one can “enter into the kingdom of heaven.” <br><br>Indeed the entire context in which this verse was placed indicates that the bar is higher for Christians.<br><br> I told some young men that the examination I wrote and passed to qualify me for a scholarship to study in the UK if it were today I’d have failed to qualify! Each generation or dispensation has its own threshold and standard of assessing who qualifies and who does not. <br><br>If this is so, then it follows that yes there is a criterion, a pass mark that one must attain to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. <br><br>So strive to attain this pass mark. The how is what follows in the second instalment. <br><br>What is important is to note that living recklessly, haphazardly, carelessly thinking o God is merciful, forgiving etc and will surely grant one a place regardless is to deceive oneself. <br><br>To excel in school we all know what it takes;  ask to be told in case you don’t! Ask Azumah Nelson what it took him to become an undefeated champion<br><br>Even the great apostle Paul said this about himself and his quest to make the grade.  Read it ; <br>1 Corinthians 9<br>KJV<br>27+ But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.<br><br>My dear, there is a pass mark to be attained. Strive to make it. Before we parted company we both agreed on how difficult it would be. But we also agreed that God has given us a bonus mark; the righteousness of Christ! This has been credited to us. All that is left for us is to  “top it up”. <br><br>God through Christ gave us 70% look for 30% to top up! <br><br>Matthew 5:20 <br>NIV<br>[20] For I tell you that <b>unless your righteousness qsurpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven</b>.<br><br>Please this is not a doctrinal teaching or belief, it is a friendly hypothesis just to warn us of the need to be prepared! Surely we must cross a pass mark. <br>Philippians 2:12 NIV<br>[12] Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed---not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence---continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,<br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Why would the resurrection from the dead of this Man bring to a stop all activities of life? This is an incomprehensible global phenomenon! <br><br>Since the beginning of time no man’s death, not presidents, monarchs etc has ever been marked worldwide than this Man. <br><br>Why is this man’s death observed, it is because it was by this event that Humanity gained its freedom from Death. <b>The resurrection of Jesus from the dead gave hope to a hitherto hopeless world that has until then been living in the fear of death</b>. <br><br>Read how the Hebrew writer described man’s hopeless state before the resurrection; <br><br>Hebrews 2:14-15 <br>NIV<br>[14] Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death---that is, the devil--- <br><br>[15] <b>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death</b><br>.<br>By His resurrection, He *destroyed both the Power and Fear of  Death! <b>He brought to life immortality</b>. A truth He stated while alive and confirmed by his coming out of the Grave. Read it;<br><br>John 11:25-26<br> NIV<br>[25] Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; [26] and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”<br><br>Beloved, if there is no resurrection free from the dead then we’ve been deceived and doomed forever. Because it is the resurrection that gives us hope that there is life beyond the Grave. <br><br>It is the resurrection of Jesus that gave us hope that we shall be given an incorruptible body with which we shall live forever. As we can all attest to  “ change and decay in all around we see”for we can not inherit the Kingdom of God while clothed in this corruptible body. <br><br>Read all that there is about this phenomenon; <br><br>1 Corinthians 15:42-44,50-55 <br>NIV<br>[42] So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; [43] it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;<br><br> [44] it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. <br><br>[50] I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. <br><br>[51] Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--- [52] in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. <br><br>[53] For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. <br><br>[54] When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”<br><br> [55] “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”<br>.<br>Yes, the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the Grave is a breakthrough for us who have placed our faith and hope in Him. <br>That we shall live forever is confirmed by this event that took place several centuries ago <br><br><b>Beloved, live your life in a manner as to benefit from this event at the end of your life's journey. Do not wait till it becomes late. Act now</b>! <br><br>Maranatha! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Though He did not state clearly the why, observing His actions does give us a clue. <br><br>The truth is the more his acts of mercy spread the more enemies he made for himself.   Read this ; <br><br>Matthew 12:13,15 <br>NIV<br>[13] Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other<br><br>[14] But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.<br><br>. [15] Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. <br><br>Even alliances of people who once were enemies, who do not see eye to eye  were formed to harm him; read it <br><br>Mark 3<br>KJV<br>6+ And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.<br><br>In real life, this happens! People who disagree among themselves will unite to fight you because you are their common enemy. Hmm, life! <br><br>I’ve heard a few try to explain the reason for Jesus’ restraint; but “me too” having considered and thought through the events/incidents have come to agree with some who think otherwise. <br><br>These say  “It is not everyone who should know or hear of your success”. Your failures they can be told! . <br><br>Others also say “do not show your wounds to everyone, not everybody has a plaster. Some will put in salt to increase your pain! “<br><br>Beloved on a personal note as I travel through life I’ve found these sayings or admonishments to be true. Perhaps you’ve experienced it yourself except that you did not take note nor care about it! <br><br>It was through experience that many understood why Jesus restrained these men not to tell everybody but was specific in one case regarding those they should tell! Read it ;<br><br>Matthew 8<br>KJV<br>4+ And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, <b>shew thyself to the priest</b>, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br><br>His success story brought him enemies It got to a point that He could not walk in the open, the same has happened to some in real life; they kept themselves away from the company of others. Read it ;<br>John 7<br>KJV<br>1+ After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.<br><br>I’ve heard some give this same restraining order to some people they helped. They told them not to tell anyone. But good deeds can not be hidden they’ll come out just as those Jesus restrained did!! <br><br>Well, all said and done the advice is out there and it is a choice. Not everyone should hear of your success. Not everyone should see your wounds! Be wise! Not everyone who smiles with you loves you. <br><br>My thoughts after thinking through why Jesus restrained some from telling people of His deeds! These are my personal opinions! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Proverbs 3<br>KJV<br>3+ Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:<br>4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br><br>The life that pleases both God and Man according to the proverbs writer rests on two pillars, mercy and truth. To show or have mercy and to speak the truth at all times. <br><br>Is it not true that people who show mercy and speak the truth are loved, admired and appreciated by the majority except a few? <br><br>To understand what mercy means in practical terms read these ; <br>Matthew 25<br>KJV<br>35+ For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<br>36+ Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.<br><br>(also read the  Parable of the Good Samaritan; that Of the Unjust Steward etc and many others ) <br><br><br>What about Truth? We are to speak truth to all just as we are to show mercy to all. Here is where the difficulty lies. Whereas those who show mercy are loved those who speak truth are hated. <br><br>Is this not a contradiction? The very person you love because he showed you mercy, the same person you hated because he told you the truth. <br><br>But what is truth? (You remembered Pilate!)<br><br>Let’s begin with what truth is not, truth is not an allegation, it is not an assumption, I think, not perception, not a conjecture! Truth is a fact, even if it is hearsay you have investigated it and can confirm it with (empirical) evidence! <br><br>Read how the Apostle John defined truth regarding the humanity of Christ when it came under dispute by the Docetists. John’s writing (1john) was a response to the philosophy called “ Docetism” derived from the Greek word “ dokea “ which translates “ to seem, look like”. <br>( More about this another time)<br><br>John introduced his letter by stating who Jesus was, <br><br>1 John 1:1-4 <br>NIV<br>[1] <b>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched</b>---this we proclaim concerning the Word of life<br><br>. [2] The life appeared; <b>we have seen it and testify to it</b>, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and <b>has appeared to us</b>. <br><br>[3] <b>We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard</b>, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. [4] We write this to make our joy complete.<br><br>So now you know what qualifies to be called truth. Facts. To speak truth is to say for sure and with certainty what one knows (substantiate with evidence when demanded or requested)  <br><br> When Nathan confronted David concerning Bathsheba, he did not state a hearsay or an allegation but undeniable facts. <br><br>This is what the proverb writer is advising us to observe, <br>Proverbs 3:1-2<br> NIV<br>[1] My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, [2] for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity.<br><br>*Mercy and Truth” should not depart from you. Show mercy , yes but also be truthful! <br><br>These are hard, difficult and expensive but they are doable if one commits himself to doing them. There is always a price to pay for everything but the rewards surpass and are worth it. <br><br>A thought to share <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

In this follow up l intend to demonstrate the example God showed us so we emulate Him. <br><br>Before Jesus came everything men knew about God was theoretical, hypothetical, etc.  When they hear “ God is love “ it does not make sense it sounds ok in the ears but it can not and is not comprehended in real terms. <br><br>Everything taught to the Jews was theoretical; you’ll remember at the funeral of Lazarus Jesus engaged his sisters in a conversation.<br><br>Well let’s replay parts of that conversation to help you understand what I mean by before Jesus came everything about God was theoretical concepts <br><br>John 11:21-26 <br>NIV<br>[21] “Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. [22] But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”<br><br> [23] Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” [24] Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”<br><br> [25] Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; [26] and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”<br><br>Here the subject matter was the “ resurrection “ and from what Martha said she has heard, and been taught all about this subject but she was made to understand that it was “ futuristic”. <br><br>No one can fault her she was right for that was what it was! Many things they were taught at their “rabbinical school” ( makaranta! Is the Muslim version) were theoretical <br><br>Now hear what Jesus said to her <br>John 11:25<br> NIV<br>[25] Jesus said to her, “<b>I am the resurrection</b> and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;<br><br>Jesus said “My dear in times past the resurrection was a concept, but standing right before you is the real thing -I AM THE RESURRECTION” In other words “ the word ( theory, concept) has become real! <br><br>This is what John meant when he said <br>John 1:14<br> NIV<br>[14] <b>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us</b>. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.<br><br>God who in the past was a concept, imaginary thought etc took upon himself flesh so He can be seen and known, no more a theory. Fili fili! <br><br>This is what John said, they experienced Him, walked and ate with Him. He was real <br><br>1 John 1:1 NIV<br>[1] That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched---this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.<br><br>To John, their preaching was not theoretical but experiential. This truly is what effective, powerful preaching/teaching is about. Experiential not theoretical! <br><br>By the coming of Jesus, the Word became flesh. God who was hitherto mere words became a reality everything said and taught about Him was made manifest and demonstrated;  made real. <br><br>In Christ, God backed His love for us in real terms! Beloved, God’s love for you is not a concept or theory ( mere words ) but real. <br><br>May we learn to practicalize our words through deeds so men will know what we mean when we say something! God showed us how to do it. <br><br>My thoughts to share <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "James 2<br>KJV<br>15+ If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br><br>16+ And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<br><br>The greatest challenge we face as Believers is our inability to translate words into deeds. If you’ve lived as long as some have you’ll understand what this means. <br><br>James saw firsthand how members of the congregation he attended were responding to an appeal made on behalf of a destitute hence his inspired rhetorical question. He wrote from practical experience and observation. <br><br>In effect, he is saying words are meaningless if not backed by deeds. We see this daily in our fellowship where some stand in the midst of the assembly and pours out their needs! In our case, beloved what do we do? We are simply asked to stand and “ commit the sister/brother to the Lord’s care”. <br><br>A long twenty to thirty-minute prayer is said citing and quoting copious verses of scriptures to remind God (as if He has forgotten)  that he must meet the needs of the one with the request. <br><br>We even issue as it were a “ veiled threat “ in our prayers by asking  Him to act to avoid disgrace before unbelievers. Who will ask “Where is our God?” <br><br>After the prayer as usual we walk to the needy to shake his/her hands and console and comfort him/her with more words; not a hint or personal assurance of help from us. <br><br>This is what James was alluding to; read it <br>James 2:16 <br>NIV<br>[16] <b>If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed</b>,” <br><br>Nyamè wô hô ôbè yè! Fama Nyame! Ôtsèsô Nyamè wô tsè à aboà entetià sô nyà bî ( forgive my poor twi!) <br><br>There have been instances where some have refused to tell their congregation the sufferings they are going through   When asked why, they replied  “ I know them they hear but do nothing! So I am better off not telling them”. O! <br><br>Yes,  beloved this is what happens when words mean nothing but sounds to some, and because they would not want their ears to be disturbed they prefer not to open up! <br><br>There is a need for us individually and collectively to examine ourselves concerning these ! Words without acts mean nothing but mere sounds to a sufferer. This trend of behaviour is very high among us. <br><br>The Apostle John also saw what James experienced; read how he put it; <br><br>1 John 3:18<br> NIV<br>[18] Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.<br><br>I, John (the minister) have also seen and continue to experience this hence what you’ve just read.

Read one; <br><br>Mark 9<br>KJV<br>33+ And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?<br>34+ But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest. <br><br>Luke 22<br>KJV<br>24+ And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.<br><br>Even two of them engaged their mother to lobby on their behalf.

    "text": "2 Corinthians 7<br>KJV<br>1+ Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br><br>This appeal by Paul continues to be valid and of great relevance today. He made mention of two types of “ filth “ the filthiness of the flesh “ and that of the “ spirit “ ! <br><br>Indeed as our cities and surroundings are engulfed by material ( physical )  filth even so are some fellowships engulfed with spiritual filth. <br><br>What is worrying is just like how we can live the filth in our community without raising a voice; even so, we can live with the spiritual filth that surrounds us in the fellowship without raising a voice. <br><br>Like society, dare to raise a voice and you’ll be shot down even so it is in some fellowships.  <br><br>But what is  “filthiness of the flesh ?” Simply put anything that contaminates and works against the natural purpose and use of the flesh. This definition is broad so you can fill in the specifics. <br><br>Any moral conduct, behavior etc that contradicts the normal, acceptable standard is a filthiness Of the flesh. <br><br>Paul gives a clue, read it <br>Romans 1<br>KJV<br>26+ For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<br><br>27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<br><br>Any abuse ( two words put together; abnormal and use =abuse, abnormal usage ) of nature results in “filthiness of the flesh” such as “gratifications” <br><br>Paul is saying, dear believer now that you have switched sides by your conversion do away with any form of abuse that will make you fleshly filthy. <br><br>Filthiness of the flesh therefore has to do with moral and ethical failure. <br><br>Do not forget, He has said ;<br>2 Corinthians 5<br>KJV<br>17+ Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new.<br><br>What about “ filthiness of spirit?” This has to do with spiritual contamination, some things contaminate the spirit, negative things that take place inside us. <br><br>Our evil thoughts and minds about someone or something etc. A contaminated spirit can not pray to God and expect to be heard. A contaminated spirit (heart)  can not offer an acceptable sacrifice ( worship ) to God<br><br>Read what Jesus said about the filthiness of the spirit and what it can not do.  <br><br> Matthew 6<br>KJV<br>14+ For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<br><br>15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<br><br>Ever wondered why your prayers are not answered? Well, among other reasons it is the spiritual filth ( hatred, envy, jealousy, evil speaking etc) that is in your heart against someone which is the reason. Your spirit is contaminated, it is filthy <br><br>Another example of spiritual filth; <br>Matthew 5<br>KJV<br>23+ Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;<br><br>24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<br><br>With a spiritually filthy heart, how can one’s sacrifice be accepted? <br><br>Finally, spiritual filth includes dabbling in spiritism and consulting with spiritualists, to invoke curses on perceived enemies. <br><br>Beloved, this is what Paul meant by his appeal ; <br><br>2 Corinthians 7:1 <br>NIV<br>[1] Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God<br><br>Let us rid ourselves of any filth be it fleshly or spiritual. <br><br>Thoughts to share. <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe.<br>",

I can't imagine Moses being a song’s teacher!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God knew long ago what we now know concerning the impact and power of songs!

We have used it to take the Sunday collection which is true and right but its significance can be felt as you age.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I remember seeing my late mother Agnes Dede Kwawu untie the end of her outer cloth to give her last pesewa to us though we could see she needed it.

    "text": "<p>Give No Ear: A Practical Advice</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7<br>KJV<br>20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.<br>21+ Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The writer of these words, Solomon to me was a pragmatist and it is this that draws me closer to him! He tells it as it is and calls a spade a spade.</p><p>How I wish I could leave behind my diaries to be read by all just like he has done with his titled Ecclesiastics! I’ve been working on mine for many years now! Hmmm! Enyè easy!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the two verses above he confirms what is true but often inadmissible by many. There is no perfect man on earth, we are all “ striving” and “learning” to be! Each one is at one stage higher or lower than the other! This is a fact of life!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7:20&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[20] Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve heard it said, “Whatever you do people will talk about you !” Have you asked why? This happens because those who are at your level of maturity understand and appreciate you whereas those below will condemn and speak evil of you! It is as simple as this</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is so because their level of understanding, knowledge and experience is lower than yours. If they wear the shoes you wore, stand where you stood, hear what you heard, and see what you saw and know what you knew ; they’ll appreciate and make informed comments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But quite often this is not the case &nbsp;It is for this reason that Solomon advised;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7:21&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[21] *Do not pay attention to every word people say*, or you may hear your servant cursing you---</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is not “every word, “ they say which is relevant some may others may not. Take the relevant and throw the irrelevant into the trash basket! In other words, do not take them to heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This calls for discernment, the ability to discern what is and what is not, and here lies the difficulty!&nbsp;<br><br>To the immature and unwise everything said ( words) is relevant. So he ends up hearing his servant cursing him which makes him go mad!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If only we could apply the “Solomonic” formula and advice to tell the relevant from the irrelevant it would help us know who to listen to or not. It is not everything said by everybody that matters.&nbsp;<br>Some things said by some matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to know where this approach is more pronounced and applicable then it is the political arena. Whatever a ruling government says or does the opposition will say the contrary. Some of the “ contrary “ statements, suggestions etc will make sense others non-sense!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved do not give ear to everything said about you, you know yourself better than they do. Listen to some, ignore others. Move on with your life, always remember people’s level of maturity informs what they see and what they say!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You owe no one an explanation except God! He will judge you according to what He knows about you He will not call any to tell Him anything about you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 Corinthians 5<br>KJV<br>10+ For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 14<br>KJV<br>10+ But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe</p>",

I have encountered frustrations and disappointments in life ( and still do!); but the ‘whispers’ of a few placed my feet firmly on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My story, like yours, is not different from that of Peter, Can you imagine the frustrations and disappointments with which he uttered these words?&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Luke 5:5</p><p>NIV</p><p>[5] Simon answered, “Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Experienced as he was in the art of fishing, he caught nothing!

We need friends who will speak to us Words of encouragement. Unfortunately, these are a few apart. On the contrary, it is the opposite that abounds!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus spoke encouraging words to Peter which resulted in success; read it&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Luke 5:6&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[6] When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many potential, gifted etc persons whose contributions be it secular or spiritual that can change the course of history and make life better for many are unable to step out because of the negative, discouraging voices that surround them.

These will say “ We ( experts ) have toiled all night catching nothing; who are you and what do you know about fishing?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, we hear this said to many today. “Who are you to say this or that ??”I like the word Peter used” <strong>Nevertheless</strong>” Yes, nevertheless, regardless of who or what “ I will give it a try”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Come to think of it, Jesus did not say anything Peter didn’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><blockquote><p>4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context seems to suggest that Peter and his crew had earlier gone on a fishing expedition which resulted in nothing. So they berthed their boats and washed their nets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><blockquote><p>Luke 5:2-3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[2] He saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[3] He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore.

    "text": "<p>I Want To Know What Love Is</p><p>1 John 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Apostle John was an eyewitness to the life of Jesus; he observed Him from a close range. As such, his writings reflect the very detailed life that Jesus led.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As is known he was the disciple who was described as the one “who leaned on his breast at supper”&nbsp; &nbsp;Read it&nbsp;</p><p>John 21</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you recall it was only John who wrote what has become the profound test of knowing what love is. Please read it?&nbsp;</p><p>John 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His epistles therefore are the account of his experiences and observations of the love that Jesus taught and practiced. It is these that informed our text for this write-up Regarding the title, listeners of music will know that it was the title of a popular hit many years ago. ( Foreigner -1984)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you want to know what love is? Then here is how it is manifested by anyone who claims to love you. Is he/she willing to “lay down his/her life “ for you?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 3:16 NIV</p><p>[16] This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To make sure his readers do not confuse what he means by “ laying down “ Of life, he added the following;&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 3:17&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[17] If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context therefore gives us the meaning of those words. There is no ambiguity about what John meant. No one can say he does not understand what he meant. When we give to someone what is of great value, to enhance his life or lift him from a low level we are “ laying down our life” for the recipient!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are too many fake, hypocritical and pretentious acts parading as love which must be exposed. These are mainly words coined to deceive and mislead the unsuspecting. Some mistook “ admiration “ for love. Which is not, unless backed with action; admiration is mere words!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John cautioned against this; read it ;&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 3:18-19&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[18] Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. [19]&nbsp;</p><p>This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A genuine action, from a genuine heart, motivated and inspired by genuine&nbsp;</p><p>concern and love for the recipient or beneficiary! This is what love is!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a practical note to illustrate, recently I was bereaved and many were those who sent their “ condolences “ my inbox was full! On the day of the funeral only a few of the many “ condolencers” showed up.&nbsp; Their “ condolences “ were mere words because they failed to translate them into deeds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you remember what John said?</p><p>1 John 3:18&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Translate your “ condolences “ into deeds this is what it means to &nbsp;“lay down one’s life”! A condolence is a sympathy, deeds (actions) translate sympathy into empathy. Beloved, sympathy and empathy are not the same, Many sympathize, only a few empathize&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With this experience, I was approached a few days ago by a brother who want to publish my second bereavement which just occurred on a platform, unfortunately, I turned down the request. I told him my inbox will be full of “condolences “ which will result in no show on the day of burial. Yes, these &nbsp;are hard and unpleasant truths known to all . Beloved, I want to know what love is!&nbsp;<br><br>We have loved each other by words for far to long, that a mere expression of sympathetic words &nbsp;( a condolence ) is interpreted as love! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Valley Of Decision!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In every man’s life, there comes a moment that demands action—a decisive moment that, if left unattended, can lead to a lifelong disaster!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the Valley of Decision, we are confronted with questions that have to do with our destiny. Questions that have to do with our spiritual, economic, social etc destinies.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decisions and choices we make will shape our life’s destinies. What we are today reflects the choices we made in the past.. What we shall be tomorrow is based on what we do or don’t do today</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some choices are irreversible and so are some decisions. Ask any aged person and he /she will confirm this to you. This is because he/she has once walked through the Valley of Decision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every step we take in every hour or day forms part of the building blocks we lay for our future. The entire structure of the building will be completed at our old age. It is for this reason that we must weigh carefully the choices we make.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It must be admitted, many of us (including this writer ) have made some irreversible choices, the consequences of which are with us today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Human as we are we can not escape such mistakes. We just have to accept and live with them till we sleep one night and wake up no more! . Though a difficult and daunting task yet we have no choice but to face it squarely&nbsp; &nbsp;To procrastinate is to postpone what will catch up with us later&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walking through the Valley of Decision in life, beloved requires help. Hear how someone who once walked through this Valley concluded;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalms 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rod and staff here indicate, training, guidance and discipline. Read a few ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Job 5</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>17</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 3</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>11</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction:</p><p><strong>12</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Hebrews 12</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>5</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</p><p><strong>6</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Corinthians 11</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>32</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He acknowledged and attributed his successful walk through this Valley to God. “I will fear no evil, for thou art with me” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, it is only with the presence of God in our lives, and the help of the Holy Spirit that we can walk successfully through the Valley of Decision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Holy Spirit will illuminate both the eye and the mind guiding and granting us the ability to discern so we make the right decisions and choices. He does these through the Word and promptings! A key feature in the believer’s daily walk with God which unfortunately the majority overlook! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Valley of Decision is a valley that some have visited and climbed out of, Make every effort to walk through it successfully!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>If you ever find yourself in the Valley of Decision do not panic seek help when and where necessary. &nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The answer I usually get always points to the “ingredients “ used.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am told by the “experts” that for a meal to pass the test, it must have the right proportions of ingredients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I found this knowledge relevant and applicable to life. For any life to be called a good life it must have in proportion all virtues. Virtues such as honesty , trustworthiness , politeness , respectfulness etc. Most important of all is “self-restraint”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the above scriptures state, “self-restraint” “ self rule “and “self-control” must be part of what it takes to be a good-natured man.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To hold one’s spirit in check no matter what the situation may be, is more to be preferred than anything else.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>32+ He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It does not take much to take a city but it takes much to rule one’s spirit. To take a city is an external warfare but to rule one’s spirit is internal which is the toughest. This explains why not many can rule their spirits!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be unable to rule one’s spirit is simply to be lacking in character, unprincipled, because <strong>character is the anchor that holds a person in check amid human storms!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may have been at some meetings where there were outbursts, tempers flaring and the atmosphere was thick and tense. This is because someone failed to ‘rule his spirit’!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be around people who have mastered the art of self-restraint is a joy and a delight, Conversations and discussions are conducted in a low tone! &nbsp;Anything said no matter how unpleasant does not provoke outbursts, silence is maintained! Each at the meeting has learned to swallow his pride!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take note, when two people standing close to each other speak (shout) to each other in a high tone then know that they are out of sync. They’ve both failed to rule their spirits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, how do we self-restrain (rule) our spirits? It begins with self-respect which is then extended to others.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next is acceptance; to accept that all men are not the same in terms of thought and practice; there will always be differences. Make room for divergent views and opinions, speak/express yours respectfully and politely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not everyone knows what you know, In life some are above you, while others are below in many respects. So factor this into your dealings with people. Learn from the one above you, and teach the one below you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learn to agree, and or disagree, know what is essential and what is not.&nbsp; In essentials stand firm on nonessential give way to liberty!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walk away from anyone who is lacking in character and is unprincipled! Avoid the “noisy”, these are vexations to the spirit&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always remember, in the midst of the unwise, it would be foolhardy to be wise. As a proverb says so “ save your breath to cool your porridge “.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always remember this;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 9:8-9&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[8] Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; rebuke the wise and they will love you. [9] Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Above all, exercise maximum self-control by putting a heavy padlock on your lips among provocateurs.

As a primary school pupil, these writings served as reading exercises as we learn to read. There were many such inscriptions; as they were the fashion of the time, owners used their vehicles to express their thoughts, feelings and sentiments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But truly speaking nothing is permanent in life not even relationships. Some we forget as we move on in life and our associations change; others we break as goals, interests, values and aspirations change. The worst of which is when a friend becomes an enemy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that what unites us as friends is our shared interests, goals, values, principles etc Whenever there is a shift or change in any of these we part company. This definition of friendship is what the prophet Amos gave&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Amos 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>3 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though this can be heartbreaking and a source of worry, we take consolation in what Solomon once said regarding the non-permanency of everything. Hence to be forewarned is to be forearmed; read it ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 3:8&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[8] a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All that is needed is for one to be prepared for any such situation, this way one can move on in life. Who you call a friend today can become your enemy tomorrow. Remain true and be committed to what is right!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, yet a little while it shall come to pass.

No one comes to the Father except through me.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I remember when I first arrived in Headington, Oxford I stayed on campus for a few days without going to the city centre though I needed a few items for use The reason was simple, I didn’t know how to get around! I felt shy to ask for help.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was no Google Maps at the time. It had not yet been invented or created.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a day or two when life was getting rough due to my lacking these basic items, I decided to go out on my own. And guess what I got lost. I struggled to find my way back to campus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the first weeks when lectures began, I made friends with some African students, fortunately, some lived in England so they knew their way around places.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing they suggested to me was to buy a guidebook. Interestingly there are guidebooks covering the entire country, mainly focused on streets. If you are in Oxford there is one solely for use there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, they also made me know that I can approach any Policeman I meet and ask for directions. Something I did when I visited London! Though some helped, others confused me the more!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully I bought a copy which settled my fear of getting lost in town! I bought those of other county’s I visited during my stay&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To know one’s destination especially how to get there is very important in life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same applies to Christianity, Jesus once told his disciples “You know the way to the place where I am going.”! He didn’t land when one ( Thomas) raised his hands to say Massa (sic) “&nbsp;</p><p>Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you notice? He said they don’t know the “ where “ and the “ how”. A destination is made up of two things the place and the how to get there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I guess you’ve heard said “ if you don’t know where you are going any direction to take will lead you there “&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is one thing to know the place and another to know how to get there! We know a place by hearing others tell us of it. This is a theoretical approach, which creates in us a desire to visit the place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We know Heaven through the stories and descriptions the scriptures provide! Read the book of Revelation and some of the things Jesus said about the place in the Gospels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Critical to the issue is how to get there. Here is where mankind is divided. Though everyone would love to be there, sadly only a few will make it. Why? Because they are not paying attention to the map!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was to avoid this that Jesus explicitly said “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rest my case. Want to go to Heaven? Here is the answer to the question “How do I get there ?” The Guide Book is the Scriptures, consult it regularly as you travel the way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There may be junctions or bypasses etc make sure you don’t miss them. Most importantly always keep your eyes on the road!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How long are you going to be here is a question no one can answer! Many have tried but to no avail. Even medical practitioners have told some that they will leave within a few months but this has turned into years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The transient and impermanent nature of our stay is what James described as a “ vapour” A vapour is a mist, it rises and within seconds vanishes into thin air. Life if compared to a flower, it grows, blossoms, gives out fragrance and thereafter withers! Who knows at which stage of this plant you are at this moment in life?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to the grass here is what Peter said about life;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Peter 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>24+ For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our beauty, handsomeness, glory, fame, popularity etc will fade with time!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Isaiah was told “ Cry” and he asked what he was to say read what he was told;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Isaiah 40</p><p>KJV</p><p>6+ The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field:</p><p>7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The psalmist also added his voice;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalms 103</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>16+ For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Scriptures record a conversation between Peter and Jesus. Peter tried to ask this very question though he didn’t put it directly; a careful reading of the conversation between him and Jesus indicates that was his intended question&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>John 21:20-23&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[20] Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[21] When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”</p><p>[22] Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[23] Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, yes the duration of our stay here is unknown as is testified to by the variations in ages we see on the funeral posters/banners of those who have been recalled! The obituary notifications.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This being the case beloved, let us make the most out of what time we are allotted! It is true none can initiate and complete whatever he/she desire; but initiate something anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is true you can not please or make everybody happy, but let a few feel happy and enjoy their time with you! This is how they will remember you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Impact a life for good and not evil! Let whatever duration you stay/spend here be meaningful! For we are here today, gone tomorrow!

[5] There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. [6] There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As stated earlier the end goal of these services (gifts) is summed up by the Holy Spirit In these words ;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 12:7&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[7] Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read “ the common good “?

By which they mean subjects such as “ baptism, weekly observance of the Lord’s Supper, giving, a cappella (unaccompanied) singing etc!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Good and relevant as these are, my target audience is not unbelievers but believers. My writings are meant to keep the saved safe. To mature them in the faith by living/leading lives that reflect their profession as believers. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My writings are inspired by the following scriptures ;&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 28</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Peter 2:2 NIV</p><p>[2] Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These and several other scriptures suggest that the saved must be kept safe, they will not be kept safe by repeatedly teaching the very same subjects that they believed and were brought into Christ. Baptism by immersion. Weekly Lord’s Supper etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are the “milk, &nbsp;“bones, meat” subjects which suggest the need for a progressive growth and development of every believer. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The continuous emphasis and teaching of these elementary subjects (post-baptism) have resulted in a lack of growth ( maturity ); evidence of which we encounter every day among us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Hebrew writer encountered a similar situation hence he wrote;&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this not a true reflection of how many look?

It does not come to me as a surprise when some don’t read them because they are content with being “spiritual infants” in Christ. A condition that manifests itself in how they behave and conduct themselves in the Assembly even though they have been in Christ for a long time!.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are wondering or asking why I don’t write about baptism, the Lord’s Supper, etc it is because some are teaching them. These are foundational settings, after which I lay blocks of “Christian character” to complete the spiritual building!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who teach such subjects and I are working together. We are both collaborating to build the church of God. Without them I can not lay the blocks of Christlike character which my writings are meant to be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This also explains why I am not into “ controversies “ but rather what will build a believer in word and deed.

How many times, and at what point have you not quoted what Paul wrote regarding things that happen to us?&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>28+ And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“And we know “ at what time did we know; is it not after we have complained? Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, whatever purpose(s) for which God called you will work well for you in the end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If He takes you through “fire/heat “He will have His Hand on the thermostat, to regulate it. Is this not what He meant when He spoke through Isaiah; &nbsp;Read it,</p><p>Isaiah 43</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are unable to accept these assurances and live with them because of two things, fear and anxiety. Admittedly we are human, none is exempt! (Not even this writer !) Ours is to wait patiently which again is a difficult thing to do!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patience is required! To walk and serve God beloved patience is required. If we do not have patience we can not serve or walk with Him This writer learnt this the hard way ( and continues to learn) and can testify that it is true.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be honest, have you not ever said in private “Why is God slow in doing this or that for me?”&nbsp; Yes! To be patient is to wait and waiting for the majority is a challenge!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, how do we learn patience?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We do this by acknowledging that we are weak, do not know it all, can not do it on our own we need help, and this help will come from someone who will act when he has time for us. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether that someone will attend to us immediately or later, we don’t know it all depends on their time and not ours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through experience, we have all been treated like this before. I have asked for help from some who acted on my request at the time they wished, even as I write some have but even said a word! Nor did they show any sign of attending to a request for help! I can not force or compel them. Mine is to wait and this is patience, painful as it may be!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if we can wait patiently for humans to attend to our needs, then we can do the same with God. The difference is, though men may disappoint, He doesn’t! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us learn to resign our wills to Him. Yes, whether we live or die, we are His. We live and serve at His pleasure! He alone “ appoints, and or dis-appoints” To Him we owe everything!.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Owû mûô, nkwa muô Nipè ènÿè hô!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Partnering For Success</p><p>Exodus 17</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is undeniable that no one can single-handedly win any battle, a truth demonstrated by the record of how Israel won its battle against Amalek.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fierce was the battle, strong were the enemies that it became necessary that an unconventional tactic has to be deployed. A tactic that involved three Moses, Aaron and Hur.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The initial arrangement was that Moses was to stand on top of a hill to be visible to the Israeli forces under the command of Joshua. He was to carry with him the rod of office&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><p>Exodus 17:9&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[9] Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[10] So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so it was when Israel engaged the Amalekites, however, a strange phenomenon was observed as the battle went on; whenever Moses lowered his hands the Amalekites broke through the Israelite defence and killed many</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it;</p><p>Exodus 17:11&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[11] As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moses, human as he is got tired of standing and holding high his hands and so the two men Aaron and Hur came to his assistance by first finding him a huge stone on which he sat and then holding his hands high in place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><p>Exodus 17:12</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held their hands up---one on one side, one on the other---so that his hands remained steady till sunset.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, what a lesson! Oh how we miss this to our loss&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one has it all. No one knows it all. No one can do it all. Success is teamwork. Success comes through collaboration. Success comes when we unite our forces, talents etc each contributing their quota.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us look at the role each played in winning the battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First God, though not mentioned yet He featured prominently in the success of Israel&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was He who ordained and empowered Moses. The rod/staff in Moses’ Hand was the sign of God’s presence with him and His authority which he wielded.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second is Moses, as the leader he must be visible hence his position on top of the hill. For a team to be successful its leader must be visible at all times. A leader must inspire and encourage those he leads. This Moses did that day. He provided what is called today Inspirational leadership&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then thirdly, Aaron and Hur, these were subordinates, it was they who mooted the idea to get Moses seated comfortably. And also supported him by holding his two arms high in place so Israel could see and advance in the battle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“They took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up---one on one side, one on the other---so that his hands remained steady till sunset.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was no rivalry. There was no undermining, Aaron and Hur knew where they belonged. Aaron was an orator as we know from the pre-exodus account.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was the spokesperson when they appeared before the pharaoh. But he never used this endowment to challenge or undermine the authority of Moses, instead, he collaborated with him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hur, we know very little about him but from the accounts, he was one of the trusted aides to Moses At one point placed Israel under his care along with Aaron during his absence. Read it&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Exodus 24</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was a confidant of Moses and played this subordinate role with distinction. Can you as a confidant and an aide be trusted as Hur was?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To succeed in any endeavor there is a need for partnership. We must partner with one another to uplift the work of God. For this to become a reality we must recognize and know our place in the scheme of things.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The spirit of rivalry, competition, etc must never be part of the project. Pride and bloated egos must be buried.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like Israel, we shall win if those who lead us will cooperate, collaborate etc with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We must also accept that in every human assembly, there must be a leader of leaders. “Primus inter pares” meaning “ first among equals “ &nbsp; It is from this Latin word that we got the term “Prime Minister” &nbsp; Failure to accept this arrangement is a recipe for failure&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aaron and Hur recognized this which led to the success of Israel! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

John wrote “ he said “ all of them admit that something was said.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To know precisely what Jesus said we have to put all three accounts together; and this is how it reads “ It is finished: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit”:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, all agreed that He gave up the ghost, but before doing so He said something!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of this write-up is to throw light on what some termed a contradiction and to show how such thoughts are resolved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many see these “missing links” in the account of the three writers as contradictions, when in fact they are not. Scriptures can not contradict themselves it is the untrained reader who sees it like that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The example has always been given by referring to newspaper reporters A, B and C sent by different news organizations to cover an accident or an event.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each presented what he saw, and they will all report the same but they may differ in a few areas&nbsp; &nbsp;This is because each reporter may have in addition to what he saw interviewed some bystanders!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a scenario like this, no one can fault any of the reporters because they published different stories of the same event.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The similarities in their report show what was obvious to everyone. The dissimilarities are a result of the interviews they had with different bystanders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rule is, to know what precisely took place one must put together the three reports published by the reporters. Similar to what you’ve just fine with the three Gospels&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear reader anytime you come across what may look to you as a “ contradiction” here is what is recommended that you do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, approach the issue with an open mind. Banish all biases, preconceived thoughts, conclusions or notions from your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, credit the Author of the Scriptures, in this case, God (Holy Spirit)! Who can not make a mistake&nbsp; &nbsp;He is all-knowing</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, look for verses, passages etc that contain similar thoughts; assemble all just as we’ve done above. Piece them together&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, seek help from historical documents that have something to do with the subject matter under discussion We call these “extra-biblical “ materials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is how we resolve what may appear to readers as biblical contradictions when in fact they aren’t.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this helps in knowing how to handle the seemingly contradictory verses in the scriptures&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Did &nbsp;Jesus Have A Social Life?&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 11:19 NIV</p><p>[19] The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was an answer to a complaint or condemnation that the jews brought against Jesus. It was like He was saying “whatever you do people will talk about you. “ &nbsp; Let us put this in context by reading the preceding verses ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 11:16-19&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>\"To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: [17] \"'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[18] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' [19] The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever you want to call it the above gives us a bird’s eye view into the social life of Jesus. That Jesus led a low-key life is undisputed. He walked with and lived among the despised, rejected, looked-down-upon members of society as confirmed by what was said concerning him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Jewish bourgeoisie found His association with the lowly unacceptable! They felt he was debasing the status and lowering the class, image, esteem etc that religious leaders are held. He was a disgrace to religious leadership!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read this ;</p><p>Luke 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.</p><p>2+ And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They even queried and questioned his disciples about this. Read it;</p><p>Mark 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unknown to them Jesus overheard what they were saying to his disciples and turned round to answer them. Read it;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>17 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He said in today’s language “ I came not to call the holier than thou’s!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truly if He were to be with us today He would love to eat at the chop bars and not restaurants let alone at Kempiski! He would love to take for breakfast koko and massa, instead of baked beans, fried eggs and toasted bread!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am not by any means saying these are bad please, (I do enjoy the same from time to time resource permitting )because He attended parties, ate at the home of some well-to-do members of society &nbsp; These were exceptions and not the rule.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, Jesus had a social life. He attended Jewish social gatherings such as weddings where songs are sung, people dance, celebrity singers, comedians etc are invited to perform!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Look for and read if you can &nbsp;“Sketches Of Jewish Social Life In The Days Of Christ by Alfred Edersheim)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today some believers have no social life simply because it is seen and regarded as evil and satanic. To sit at a table at a wedding party with someone unknown or who does not attend his fellowship is a sin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To play and listen to a song by Tracy Chapman ( Words don’t come easily ) Boney M ( by the rivers of Babylon) James Brown ( Say It Loud) Wilson Pickett (Midnight Hour) Percy Sledge ( Take time to know her) all these are sinful&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To go out with loved ones to eat banku and tilapia at a kenkey joint, to go to the gym and exercise (or at home) with a secular song in the background to help the step-by-step movements during the exercise and make the practice pleasant is evil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It must always be “ Jerusalem My Happy Home, Blest Be The Tie ( meanwhile the tie that binds is a curse and questionable!)! Yes, these are beneficial and have a place but are the spiritual, not the social life. Many have mistaken the spiritual for the social.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Man must have both the spiritual and the social not leaving out the economic life. We go to work ( economic) we attend church ( the spiritual) we must also sit, eat,&nbsp; chat,&nbsp; laugh etc ( Social)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the scriptures, it is evident that Jesus had a social life. Do you have a social life?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts.&nbsp;</p>",

Some call it “ domsor!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Load shedding was an exercise introduced by the power-generating companies as a way of rationing the limited power they can generate. It was a “burden sharing “ exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This took place at a time when the economy was not in good shape and generating inputs were not available so power plants could not operate at full capacity. Time tables ( schedules) were published and reviewed weekly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is the hardship and discomfort that this exercise imposed on the citizenry that made the term “ load shedding” repugnant and nobody wants to hear it again&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But come to think of it, the power producers were only complying with what the scriptures enjoined us believers to do-share with others the limited available resources&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the power rationing period the communities were zoned and power was supplied in an alternative fashion. Zone A gets it for a certain duration. After which Zone B and thereafter Zone C!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In effect, we were “ bearing one another’s burden” sharing the discomfort and inconvenience in a way as not to disadvantage anybody. No one must be left in darkness which is exactly what the above scriptures teach.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one must go to bed on an empty stomach. No one must be denied pleasure or enjoyment; all must enjoy no matter the degree or different levels of enjoyment. The bottom line is that everyone must be happy. This is what “ Bear year one another’s burden “ means.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the above scriptures have one thing in common ; load ( burden )&nbsp; sharing ! Those who have must support those who don’t have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>John spoke to this subject more practically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Read it</p><p>1 John 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>17+ But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>James also added his voice to burden sharing when he asked ;</p><p>James 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p><p>16+ And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our rural communities, we see this ( burden sharing ) in action, The following are shared; poverty is shared, pain is shared, sorrow is shared, Joy is shared! When one suffers all suffer, when one is blessed all share in it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We also see these among genuine friends and lovers; when one is down all help to lift him. When one suffers a mishap all rally round to offer help.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not so among many believers! To them, it is “ everybody for himself, God for us all” &nbsp; Every body for himself, God for us all is an economic philosophy the practice of which creates individual wealth, which &nbsp; eventually divides society as a result of the wide&nbsp; gap between the&nbsp; haves and the have-nots &nbsp; a source of social inequality&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas “ burden sharing “ is a philosophy that creates social equality regardless of the prevailing economic inequality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Burden sharing therefore is a social philosophy the pursuit of which will lead to social peace and harmony. The apostles practised this; read the outcome&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</p><p>35+ And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</p><p>( Burden sharing in action )&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is my view that many mistook an economic philosophy for the social. Everybody for himself, God for us all is not a social bug an economic philosophy! It is a driving force behind wealth creation&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we therefore desire to create a community of love, just, equal etc then we must revisit the concept of “ load shedding “ ( burden sharing ) where generated power was rationed so no one was left in total darkness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts as I reread the scriptures that command us to “ bear ye one another’s burden “. Bear ye one another’s burden is a social philosophy, not an economic one. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pursue the everybody for himself, God for us all philosophy to create wealth, after which you practice the social philosophy of “ burden sharing” where you share with the disadvantaged what wealth you’ve created.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

In the face of the realities of life we are not immune, no one can deny the fact that he/she have not experienced disappointments in life. We are flesh and blood! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we are immune because of the faith that lives in us.

You must maintain a level that will sustain and support you, always take a booster dose from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This you do by setting aside a day to fast, pray and read the Bible not for anything but to boost your spiritual immune system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read John said,</p><p>1 John 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. 1 John 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Faith is the victory we know that overcomes the world! So always check your faith level lest it fail you at the time you most need it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved,&nbsp; there are two tools God gave us which we have, in our armoury; these are ‘reason’ and ‘faith’! Human effort is based and grounded in reasoning, the application of the mind, the intellect, experience etc to solve a problem Reason therefore is the first tool to apply when you encounter any challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second tool is faith.

Yes, when walking by “sight” (reason) fails that is when we walk by “ faith “. There is a limitation to human reasoning, but there is no limitation to faith in God. The greater the faith the greater the victory. So, grow your faith not forgetting to grow your reasoning ability also.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, troubles will come our way because we are human but we are equipped to overcome them through faith and reason.

There were in total seventy.&nbsp;</p><p>Genesis 46</p><p>KJV</p><p>26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>27+ And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But after many years when they were leaving Egypt scriptures state&nbsp; the following;&nbsp;</p><p>Deuteronomy 10</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Exodus 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>37+ And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seventy (70) went in, six hundred thousand (600,000) came out excluding children. A nation was born.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A nation was born, organization was needed. Laws ( a constitution) to regulate and hold the nation were needed. Structures and institutional arrangements are needed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These were the reasons why they were taken through the long route to enable them to learn the lessons of nationhood! Hitherto they were a disorganized clan groupings with no cohesion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do we stand to learn from these experiences? A lot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Individually we need to know that though God has plans for our lives these will not materialise if He does not first take us through some rigorous training.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ask anybody who is “ well to do “today and he/she will tell you how far he/she has come. The ups and downs, the rise and fall, the pains and the sufferings. The disappointments and regrets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God will not give you precious things if you fail His training. If you’ve not learn how to handle GHC10, He will not give you GHC 100&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this not what Jesus meant when He said;&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 16:10-12</p><p>NIV</p><p>[10] “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[11] So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? [12] And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many a child of God has asked why they are going through difficulties in life when they ought to be enjoying! What you’ve just read is the answer. You are simply not faithful in the little blessings He bestowed on you. Yes, the truth is painful but that is it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just look at how employees handle the properties of their employers. Just watch how people entrusted with little authority exercise it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just look at how some tenants handle the rooms they rent. Just watch how some taxi drivers handle the taxis they are given to drive. You’ll often hear them say “ oh if I buy my own you’ll see how I’ll handle it” which wish never comes because they are dishonest with someone else’s. Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you now see why some are unable to make progress in life? Because they fail the training lessons of God. The little blessings God blessed them with were either misapplied or misused.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The subject paper in which most believers had zero was that of benevolence. They passed papers in church attendance, taking the Lord's Supper, not giving tithes, not using instruments in singing, you name it!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They failed miserably in the benevolence papers. They failed in both papers one and two. &nbsp; Paper one they had -selfishness, paper two -selfishness These were written across their answer sheets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is what was written boldly underneath their papers as the answers expected; read it.&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>24+ There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>26+ He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some gave up on the training. To them, the envisaged training is too tough so they did not attempt it at all. The one talented man was their role model so they had nothing to their credit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Others attempted but failed because they misused their first credit (blessing) through selfishness! Remember what Jesus said&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 16:10</p><p>NIV</p><p>[10] “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, the lesson is this God takes us through the “ wilderness “ of pain/suffering etc to see how we would use whatever He will bestow on us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not many were born with silver spoons in their mouths; you may be one but today look at the type of spoon that is in your mouth! Is it silver,&nbsp; wooden or none&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those born without silver spoons in their mouths but now have them are those who passed the test of honesty, faithfulness. Etc. &nbsp;They were faithful in little hence they were blessed with more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always remember that when God takes you through the “wilderness” it was to prepare you for a better future! So do not be afraid to go through the wilderness. Let me conclude with this promise!&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremiah 29</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trust God to take you through the wilderness safely till you set foot in the promised land of greatness and glory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p>",

I stand at the banks of “River Grief” today waiting for the strength to cross it. River Grief has overflowed its banks and is threatening to wash me away.

    "text": "<p>A Matter Of Concern: The Lamentations Of An Old School Boy! &nbsp;</p><p>Luke 16:15</p><p>NIV</p><p>[15] He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.)</p><p>(KJV)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was many decades ago, in fact in my youthful days that these words were drummed into my ears; to the intent that I should not seek fame or popularity the wrong way. &nbsp;Human endorsement through the wrong means/reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those were the days, just like it is today that everybody wants to be somebody! Everybody wants to be seen, and be regarded as “somebody” and to achieve this one has to do something weird and unusual!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like today, morality was turned upside down through the wearing of special hairstyles, indecent clothing, and vulgar appearances with earrings tucked in men’s ears. Men plaiting their hair just like women.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At that time it was on a minimal scale not full-blown as today. Surely this way you’ll attract attention and be seen as different. This was an era we called the “ justify your inclusion” era “be in or be left out.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few drifted and joined the “immoral revolution” instead of upholding the “ moral revolutionary principles “ bequeathed This was how we got to where we are today. A generation failed to uphold, protect and defend values that was bequeathed to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today the unacceptable of the past has become acceptable. Men wearing earrings were unknown then, and men with unkempt beards and hair were unknown then. What we now know as “Rasta hairstyle” was the preserve of the mentally challenged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wearing trousers with cuts/holes all over was also the preserve of the mentally challenged! Wearing and exposing undergarments as outer covering, even the bras of women were concealed. Not anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today you must expose the “not to be exposed” in public, “do the not to be done “ in public “ behave unbehavingly (sic) ” in public etc; all in the name of seeking attention, popularity and recognition! Validation is the word.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What made many uncomfortable then, makes the majority comfortable today. The apologists of these would say “ society is dynamic, social change is inevitable”&nbsp; which is true; but social values are non-negotiable, they are the basis of social cohesion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the sixties/seventies, there was this moral upheaval in the form of a lifestyle known as the hippie lifestyle. It was characterised by drug abuse, open confrontations with the law etc. It was a “ protest culture “ which is what every negative moral revolution is.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved in the midst of all these may we remember at all times and in all generations that “ What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>May we also note and observe these cautionary warnings ;</p><p>Romans 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Peter 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</p><p>15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</p><p>16+ Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like the psalmist, let us pray this prayer always ;</p><p>Psalms 51</p><p>KJV</p><p>10+ Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you’ll bear with the “lamentations” of the “old school boy”! He is not a “Mr Kill Joy” but a realist and a Christian pragmatist!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A word to the wise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

I was told he was a young man who grew up in one of the poor communities in Accra.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His early life showed no promise of an outstanding future, he struggled through school&nbsp; &nbsp;What made his story pathetic &nbsp;was that his mates were from well-to-do homes, with signs of a great future. He was seen as a failure!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In his community, &nbsp;because of the poverty of his parents, he was despised and unrecognized. But as fate would have it he graduated with flying colors and decided to join the military. Which he did.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is where the story becomes interesting, upon graduating from the military academy as a second lieutenant, that very day of graduating &nbsp;he walked from the Teshie Military Academy to the community where he grew up fully dressed in his military attire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On his arrival, he went round the various houses where he was known to be a “ nobody “ to greet the occupants! You can imagine the surprise on the faces of the naysayers&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is exactly what the scriptures above mean!

If they do they’ll know that He can mend that which is broken, bring back to life that which is dead etc!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God can bring us from dishonor to honor, from disgrace to grace, despised and rejected to be acknowledged and respected. This is the transformative power of God! He does so to prove that no one who believes in Him shall be the same! A new life He gives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved you are a testimony of this, the transformative power of God as long as you continue to walk in the Light as He is the Light; your fellowship with Him remains intact.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hallelujah, thanks be to Him who has made us who and what we are today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I Want To Know What Love Is</strong></p><blockquote><p>1 John 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Apostle John was an eyewitness to the life of Jesus; he observed Him from a close range. As such, his writings reflect the very detailed life that Jesus led.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As is known he was the disciple who was described as the one “who leaned on his breast at supper”&nbsp; &nbsp;Read it&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>John 21</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you recall it was only John who wrote what has become the profound test of knowing what love is. Please read it?&nbsp;</p><p>John 15</p><blockquote><p>KJV</p><p>13+ Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His epistles therefore are the account of his experiences and observations of the love that Jesus taught and practiced. It is these that informed our text for this write-up Regarding the title, listeners of music will know that it was the title of a popular hit many years ago. ( <strong>Foreigner -1984</strong>)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you want to know what love is? Then here is how it is manifested by anyone who claims to love you. Is he/she willing to “lay down his/her life “ for you?&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:16&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To make sure his readers do not confuse what he means by “ laying down “ Of life, he added the following;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:17&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[17] If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context therefore gives us the meaning of those words. There is no ambiguity about what John meant. No one can say he does not understand what he meant. When we give to someone what is of value and importance, to enhance their life or lift them from a low level we are “ laying down our life” for the recipient&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are too many fake, hypocritical and pretentious acts parading as love which must be exposed. These are mostly words coined to deceive and mislead the unsuspecting. Some mistook “ admiration “ for love. Which is not, unless backed with action; admiration is mere words!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John cautioned against this; read it ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:18-19&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[18] Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. [19]&nbsp;</p><p>This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A genuine action, from a genuine heart, motivated and inspired by genuine&nbsp;</p><p>concern and love for the recipient or beneficiary! This is what love is!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a practical note to illustrate, recently I was bereaved and many were those who sent their “ condolences “ my inbox was full I had a tough &nbsp;time deleting ! On the day of the funeral only a few of the many “ condolencers” showed up.&nbsp; Their “ condolences “ were love by words /speech because they failed to translate them into deeds. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you remember what John said?</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:18</p><p>NIV</p><p>Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, translate your “condolences “ into deeds This is what it means to “lay down one’s life”! A condolence It is a sympathy; it is deeds (actions) &nbsp;that translate sympathy into empathy. Beloved, sympathy and empathy are not the same. Many sympathize, only a few empathize&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With this knowledge and experience, I was approached a few days ago by a brother who wants to publish my second bereavement, which just occurred on a platform. Unfortunately, I respectfully turned down the request. I told him my inbox will be full of “condolences “ which will result in no show on the day of the burial.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seriously speaking, I can do without the expression of a condolence; what I can not do without is your presence. These are hard and unpleasant truths known to all but less expressed in the open. &nbsp;Beloved, I simply want to know what love is from you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Little memory, &nbsp;little recording, short recalling. This explains why some remember, while others forget!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A little ( short) memory is like having a pocket diary with few sheets to write things that happen to you daily.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An example is the 10 lepers who were healed by Jesus. Nine had low memory ( few sheets to write on) hence they quickly forgot what Jesus did for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The one who came to thank him had a large storage ( many sheets to write on) capacity.

He/she has a short memory capacity. An underdeveloped mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you can see and understand things this way you’ll never be bitter, provoked , worry or disturbed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are some with low memory capacity, they easily forget what you’ve done for them.

It is a prescription for anxiety, depression, hopelessness&nbsp; etc&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A careful look at the content suggests that the writer's thought was both reflective and futuristic. It embodies the psalmist's past, present, and future experiences and expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He is in effect saying “Because of what I have experienced with God, I am confident of the future”. Ever heard of the song “ because He lives, I can face tomorrow “Yes that’s the spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is exactly what the mind of every believer should be. Based on what we have experienced, we look forward with greater hope and encouragement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The picture or image painted by the verse is one of serenity. It is like sitting at a poolside looking deep into the still water! The serene atmosphere, the fresh air etc all add to heal and restore a down-spirited soul and body.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No wonder he added ;&nbsp;</p><p>3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The psalmist is saying God saw how depressed and disillusioned I was, so He made me lie down at a place he described as “ green pastures” &nbsp; As if that is not enough he took me from this place to another which he described as “ still waters” so I can feel the freshness and the breeze!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear reader, whose anguished and depressed soul will not be restored at such places? That the writer wrote from experience is reflected by these verses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Otis Reading, the late soul singer who accidentally died in a plane crash (1967) wrote a song titled “Sitting on the Dock of the Bay “. A line that reads “ watching the ships roll by “ is a picture created from these verses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there is soo much around us that God has freely given to us to revive and rejuvenate our spirits but we are not taking advantage of them. All because we are too “busy” running around!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Freshness and longevity of life are hidden in nature. If we can appreciate and cooperate with nature we shall live healthy and long lives!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you lonely, downhearted, etc Take a trip to Shai Hills., to watch the monkeys and birds of many colors, or drive to Aburi stop at the Peduase Point, turn round and take a look at the Accra Plains from that height. Wow, you’ll say.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Funny, any time I drive through and experience this sight it brings to mind what the scriptures said concerning the temptation of Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p>Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>8+ Again, the devil taketh =him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Surely a beautiful and grand scene this must be, similar though on a miniature scale&nbsp;</p><p>to what you’ll see from the top of Aburi!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The twenty-third psalm is a prescription, offering us an insight into what can rejuvenate us; read it again and reflect on it. &nbsp;Decide where to visit to refresh your anguished soul!

Words that drop from our lips guarded or unguarded are what have brought us to where we are today. The timing of what one says, where one says it and to whom is very important&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wherever you’ve found yourself today is as a result of the use to which you put your mouth. In other words, the things you said, how and when you said them and to whom are the reason you are who/what you are today, whether good or bad.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me be practical and clear, there are times you’ll say good things but yet receive bad treatment; just as there are times you’ll say bad things and yet receive good treatment. Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why is this so, one may ask? Dear reader it is a question of audience. In the company of evil men, the good you’ll say will land you in trouble.

So know where and to whom you talk to.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I read something Jesus said to a man He healed he told him not to tell anyone but instead go and see the priest and perform a rite.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read a few of them&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p><p>3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean.

    "text": "<p>Your Word As A Currency</p><p>Matthew 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>8+ The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What you’ve read above expresses an explicit trust that surprised Jesus. The centurion believes that a word spoken by Jesus from a distance can resolve a problem or a challenge!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This expression of trust amazed Jesus so much that He reacted; read it,&nbsp;</p><p>10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isn’t it strange that people you walk or work with do not trust you but strangers do? Yes, such is life. Yes, this happens when you have fake and pretentious people around you pretending to be friends! In this case, the Jews had difficulty believing Jesus but not this stranger!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The centurion, a total stranger in Israel’s expression of faith in Jesus is summed up in these words of John ;&nbsp;</p><p>John 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 13+ Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That faith transcends ethnicity or tribe is emphasized by the thirteenth verse ;&nbsp;</p><p>13+ Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The centurion was not an Israelite but received the blessing and approval of God by faith. This is recorded to teach us that it is not all who say Lord Lord but those who believe and act on that belief! The centurion believed and acted on that belief.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read what Jesus said to him;&nbsp;</p><p>13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What took place that day fulfilled what was written several centuries before Christ ;</p><p>Psalms 107</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</p><p>21 Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To understand what the psalmist meant by “ he sent his word “ you’ll have to read what John said concerning the “ word”. Who was that Word?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John 1:1,14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [14] The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the Word that was sent to heal and deliver them from destruction as stated by the psalmist.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This incident also raises a lot of questions, that as believers we must answer. Beloved can men trust your words? Can someone walk away from you just because you’ve spoken? Does your word carry weight?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In case you don’t know, a word is a currency its value depends on your actions. The performance or otherwise of things you say adds value or devalues them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some people’s words are worthless, valueless and are rubbished. They are like a devalued currency because they are not backed by deeds. Is that you?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This centurion has watched Jesus from afar and has concluded that His words alone are valuable hence his insistence that he speaks just “ the word” and should not bother to come to his house.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, that men can believe our words and take them on face value! Just like you, I know people whose words I believe without a doubt; and some I doubt or take ‘with a pinch of salt!’&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear reader, your word is a currency therefore give it value by backing whatever you say with deeds. The more you back it with action the greater value and respect is attached to it. So much so that even on your sick bed your word alone can settle a debt or buy you medication from far.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ever heard the title “ òsèôdèôyò, that is the title of someone whose words ( currency) have high value because he backs them with deeds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be that person whose (Words) currency can be accepted and recognized everywhere as worthy and a legal tender!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Words words words! Read what Jesus said about the exchange rate of words!&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>37+ For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The exchange rate of your words fluctuates depending on your actions or inactions so be careful!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share, a challenge to all.&nbsp;</p>",

When a bird wanders from its nest what happens to it? The answer is obvious it gets caught and finds itself in a soup pot!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same happens to a man who wanders from his place except that he does not get “killed “ but instead is disrespected, disorganized and disoriented.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To “wander from one’s place” is to depart from established norms and principles! This unfortunately is the challenge we face today! Principle-less&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have ruined everything that we came to meet as a generation.

It has to do with the uncertainty of death, and the fact that death does not discriminate!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Death does not know whether you are old or young, married or unmarried, rich or poor, nursing mother with a baby or not, employed or unemployed etc. This is what the title means if said in the Ga dialect. Green leaves fall, and so do dried ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I went out today, Saturday and every public space is occupied with nothing but funeral observances. Posters in town read “What a shock” “ Gone too soon” “ Home Call” “ Call to Glory “ “ At Rest “&nbsp; “ A life Well Lived “.&nbsp; These have to do with the deceased.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All these point to one fact, which Moses summarized in his prayer&nbsp;</p><p>Psalms 90</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Teach us to number our days he said not years. Each day counts not the years.. What we do each day with our lives is important; yearly celebration is a total of what transpired each day.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we spend each day wisely, and purposefully we shall find cause to rejoice in the yearly celebration! The greatest challenge we have faced as humans is how to “apply our hearts into wisdom”!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Foolishness, recklessness, not valuing life etc have rather gained our attention! The majority waste their days chasing and pursuing the irrelevant, majoring in the minor etc! Plotting and planning evil against others as if they will have access to the properties of the one they plot against.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fact remains that if you harm or eliminate someone nothing of his will come to you. His knowledge, wealth, fame, wisdom, handsomeness, beauty etc will not come to you. You’ll still be the same.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes. Moses was right!</p><p>Psalms 90</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To apply one’s heart to wisdom is to be thoughtful, discerning, cautious etc in every step one takes in life. Yes take risks, but let them be “ calculated risk”. &nbsp;Even faith is not blind it is the assurance of things hoped for “ the evidence “ of things not seen”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life is not about “noise making”, it is not about “ rabble rousing “ it is about intelligent thinking, planning and living! It is about walking in the principles as taught by the Word of God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who numbers his days is like; &nbsp;</p><p>Psalms 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>3+ And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rest my case. A word to the wise and discerning is enough!&nbsp;</p>",

Followers of my write-ups will recall I’ve discussed this subject before, many years ago! I am back again because many have asked to know if Jesus was a type, a celebrity etc!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In an age and time when men of God desire to be known, treated and revered as “ celebrities” the same can not be said of the Man whose servants they proclaim to be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, Jesus did not leave us with a photograph or portrait but the descriptions the Holy Spirit gave us are enough to help us know what He looked like. One such passage that describes Him is what you’ve read above.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again ;</p><p>Isaiah 53:2&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[2] He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground.

A public display to enhance our superiority. He sat on a donkey with no one holding its rein, today we are chauffeur-driven, on some occasions with police escorts&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even when we arrive at venues we wait for some time before stepping out, and we have the doors open for us by bodyguards. Yes. Red carpets are strewn in our paths for us to walk on!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He sat and ate with the ordinary a practice we see as unfit and belittling; an anathema!

The tv cameras must be on us!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus was not a celebrity, He lived a simple lifestyle! I can hear some say, yes that’s true but times have changed! This is not true, he lived in a sophisticated and advanced culture and civilisation but none of these influenced him!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s men of God must return to the basics.

    "text": "<p>The Mystery Of A Day</p><p>Matthew 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>34+ Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I woke up to this verse firmly rooted in my mind, and I then paused to reflect and think of its meaning and implications. Here is what I came up with, which I share with you! What Is A Day?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A day is like a journey that begins from the very hour we wake. The moment your eyes open is as if you’ve landed at an airport and the plane has taxied to a stop.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Coming out of the bedroom is like walking through the arrival immigration checkpoint and your praying and composing yourself before you leave the bedroom is like collecting your luggage from the roller.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first person(s) you meet and greet are your arrival team waiting to receive and welcome you. Do you notice how every first morning greeting is said with a broad smile? Yes indicating joy and happiness for seeing each other. Just as happens at every reception point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The newness and mystery of each day is like entering a town for the first time not knowing what goes on unless you get there. Everything you see or hear is new!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every day we see, we hear and we say new things. Every day’s experience is new!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A day is full of mysteries as nobody knows what it holds in store for them! Some miscalculations, misjudgments will be made because everything is new, you are encountering them for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People you’ll meet will tell you things you’ve not heard before. They’ll ask questions you’ve not thought about; all combined will put stress on your mind as you listen trying to make sense of whatever you hear! The questions will task your mind to think.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every encounter, every experience is new! Even if you think it is a routine it is always new because there is always an addition to what existed yesterday&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A day is indeed a journey, you have never walked through it before. It is for this reason that you must begin each day well prepared spiritually, mentally and emotionally. For you don’t know the challenges, trials, temptations etc. that may come your way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Focus therefore on the day in hand and not that of tomorrow, take each day ( journey) seriously. I am persuaded to believe that this is what Jesus meant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 6:34&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[34] Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore enjoy today’s “ journey “ as I write this it’s seven (7) am, my plane just landed and I am getting ready to step out of it. I am yet to meet a welcoming party to say good morning!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy the beauty of the day, have fun do not over stress yourself. Admire everything! It is a journey enjoy the trip, soon departure time ( night) will come and announcements will be made asking you to board your flight back to bed!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts to share, each day is indeed a mystery. You’ve never walked through it before. May God grant you the wisdom to go through the journey of today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Adversity Seen Through A Positive Eye</p><p>Psalms 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bold and a courageous affirmation you’ve just read from a man who&nbsp; turned adversity into an advantage, impossible to possible, tears to joy, poverty to riches, dishonor to honor, grass to grace, Yes this is David, reflecting on his experiences&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike many, David saw the positive side of every adversity that befell Him. To him, anything that happened has a positive value or lessons to teach him. This is what he meant when he said&nbsp;</p><p>“Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the rod and staff describe the two ends of the same stick a shepherd carries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two ends of the shepherd’s “ stick “ are not the same both in shape and usage. One end is straight the other curved. One end is used to guide ( the straight end)&nbsp; the other ( the curved) is used to punish. There are times when both ends are used simultaneously to punish.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Adversity, tragedy, mishap, misfortune etc contrary to what the majority thinks, are God’s ways to redirect us. David knew this from experience hence what he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved many of us will say the same regarding things that have happened to us, by which means we are who and what we are today. I discovered my gift of writing when I left the pulpit. Instead of lamenting the Holy Spirit directed me to the pen!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Words either spoken or written are weapons that no one can stop! The pen is mightier than the sword. Through writing, I have probably preached almost half of the sermons I’ve preached orally though the audience may be small I’ve reached many than I would have if I were glued to one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What about people with physical disabilities? Take a look at the great things most of them have done. Yes, physical disability is not mental or intellectual disability! It is God’s way of directing their destinies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, God uses adversities to redirect our destinies. This is the beauty of adversity and this is how it should be seen. Ever heard the saying “ when sea dry we go by land ?” Adversities should not stop us, they are meant to redirect, refocus, and reset so we can climb up to higher grounds in life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this not what James meant when He said;&nbsp;</p><p>James 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 3+ Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4+ But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This situation is truly difficult to understand if one is not wise and this is why James added the following verse; read it&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So now, you see why James mentioned wisdom? Pay attention to the context. It is a prescription To see and turn adversity into an advantage you’ll need wisdom! Which is true and it is only the wise who see adversity as an opportunity!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All that I’ve said so far is not to downplay the negative effects and or the consequences of adversities. No on the contrary I acknowledge that they can and are very devastating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, they are the Divine means by which our destinies are redirected. So wake up, wipe the tears, stop complaining, look beyond them, see (visualise) the glory and the goodness that lies ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With God all things are possible and with Christ, you are more than a conqueror! This is how many have turned adversities into advantages! You can also do the same.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Adversities Re-position Us”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Treasure What You’ve Found! &nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Matthew 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p><p>46+ Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a society where the majority settles for anything this merchant is presented to us as a man of different character.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of settling for anything, he chose to first investigate before making a move.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the context as we read, the statement is about the “kingdom of heaven”, which “kingdom” is represented on earth by the church of Christ!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lesson is don’t settle for anything ( church) until you’ve investigated its quality, and by extension take time to study before you join any religious group.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Apply the same spirit of curiosity to almost everything. Is it business, friendship, social club, marriage etc; take time to examine everything! Many have joined groups, churches, social clubs, marriages etc only to regret. Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of the church, many had to move from one church group to another before finally settling down with the church that is mentioned and described in the New Testament! Like the merchant, they were equally looking for a pearl of great value in terms of biblical truth/teaching and practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second lesson from the action of this merchant is that he “gave up to give in ”when he found the best. One word describes what he did: commitment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was influenced by the phrase I’ve often used, <i>“ Decision determines destiny “</i>. It was a critical step, choice and decision he made.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of commitment has been identified as a major factor in the failure of many an enterprise be it religious, social or economic! Commitment is the ingredient that brings to life dreams and aspirations!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve heard the saying <i>“ if wishes were horses, beggars would ride to hell” </i>! Yes, it is our commitment that translates dreams into reality, or else they remain wishes. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there are many on the periphery of life, many with their heads full of dreams and wishes, but what they lack is the initial spark and commitment to turn that spark into a flame!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve given up all you had to get whatever you now have, then be committed to it else your loss will be devastating! Give heed to the Apostle John’s exhortation ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 John 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a lighter note, we were blessed and privileged to locate this Merchant and asked him how he felt after giving up all to get what he got; he asked instead to sing a song as his answer! And here is what he sang,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>I have decided to follow</i></p><p><i>Jesus, no turning back,&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>No turning back!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Cross before me</i></p><p><i>The world behind me&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>No turning back&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>No turning&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Though none will</i></p><p><i>Go with me,</i></p><p><i>Still, I will follow&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>No turning back “</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We walked away believing that we had met a mentor, a great example of what it means “ decision determining a destiny.!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</p><p>25+ Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wish I were a painter, this is one picture I’ll paint and hang on my wall to remind me of the need to be cautious. Can you imagine this happening to the great Apostle Paul?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Someone who stood before Felix and Agrippa, and several others spoke powerfully without fear or intimidation. Yes!&nbsp; Yet here is he being put in a large-sized laundry basket! Carried, towed or dragged on the floor pushed through an opening in a wall.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not only this, there was another threat to his life which was revealed to him by his nephew! As a result, the authority took measures to protect him.&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Acts 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ And when Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</p><p>17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why didn’t he say to his nephew “ Oh God will take care of me so don’t worry ?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, there comes a time and moment when even the strong yield to weakness. Surely Paul was not the first nor the last, visit Elijah and interview him you’ll hear the same story. Read his account ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Kings 19</p><p>KJV</p><p>2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.</p><p>3+ And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer–sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4+ But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was shortly after the local newspapers and social media have published the events that took place on Mount Carmel. Everyone was expecting to see the hero of the day, so the streets were lined up expecting Elijah. Only to be told he has fled!&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, even the strongest of the strong is also human, the blood that flows through our veins is the same that flows through his.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both Elijah and Paul took measures to protect themselves. Even Jesus did the same as recorded read it ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>John 7</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It would be foolhardy if the three mentioned ignored the threats to their lives. Even so, it would be foolhardy today if any should ignore threats to their life all in the name of “ God will protect me”. Is God unable to protect Paul, He can but Paul agreed to the advice and suggestion to be put in a basket!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are always physical,&nbsp; spiritual ( or both) threats to our lives, from both known and unknown sources, ignore these at the peril of your life. Even friends we eat and socialize with can become security threats.&nbsp;</p><p>.</p><p>Did the Lord not acknowledge this? He did hear him;&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 10</p><blockquote><p>KJV</p><p>36+ And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And also the psalmist, read what he wrote from experience,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalm 55:12-14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were rising against me, I could hide.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[13] But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend, [14] with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship at the house of God, as we walked about among the worshipers.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, threats ( physical or spiritual) to our lives are real do not underestimate or downplay any. Paul took his seriously, Jesus did the same and so was Elijah. It would be foolhardy to ignore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Watch and pray He said. He did not say we close our eyes and pray. It is like saying to us; listen around, pay attention to developments around you. Watch the movements around you. Discern actions even words that are spoken reveal threats so think through whatever you hear.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every man of value and importance to God /society /family/workplace etc is a target if you are one of these then do not let your guard down! Watch and pray listen to and take advice</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul did and was delivered learn to do the same. You are of value and importance to us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share; a word to the wise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p><strong>What And Why Do We Easily Forget?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>James 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>25+ But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like many of you, I have often struggled to remember important calendar dates, such as birthdays and anniversaries. The reason(s) for these form the basis of this article.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many have accused me of forgetting their birthdays, marriage anniversaries, outdooring, and other such ceremonies and they are right in doing so. I’ve always pleaded guilty and offered sincere apologies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But why is it so, is a question I set out to find out and here is what I discovered!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anything that does not occur daily, any item that I don’t use daily, falls under this category. Birthdays don’t occur every day, marriage anniversaries do not occur every day so the possibility of me forgetting them is high. You can make a list of things that do not occur daily in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, there are two most important things that can be so embarrassing in life if forgotten! You may ask what these are? I’d love to leave it to you to find out but for the sake of time, I’d like to help!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are passwords and scriptures! These two if not used regularly can be forgotten with dire consequences!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine standing in front of an ATM Machine on a cashless day trying to withdraw money for the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine trying to open your laptop or tablet and being requested to input your password because it has been a long time since you used it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What about the scriptures?</p><p>Imagine being confronted with a spiritual challenge, and you open the Bible to read a verse that will comfort and help you pray, only to discover you’ve forgotten the book, chapter and verse where to find the verse.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine being engaged with someone in a discussion in which you have proven publicly that the other party is in the wrong, and he demands to know the passage of scripture that forms the basis of your conclusions. You took the Bible flipped through but could not locate the verse.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dearly beloved, like passwords, the bible if not regularly studied or read the tendency to forget its contents are very high. So to avoid this use your passwords regularly and read the Bible daily</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The majority have put their passwords as it were on “autopilot”, once signed in they never revisit it again. These do argue “ oh I don’t have time to be retyping “&nbsp; &nbsp;It is when the equipment crashes or gets corrupted that is when they see the importance of typing in the password regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the way many have put their lives ( mind, brains!) on “ autopilot “ they are not learning anything new. They are content and satisfied with what they knew several years ago! It is these who resist change everywhere hence the lack of development and growth wherever they find themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you care to know “ autopilot” is a lazy way of living, a lazy way to lead people or institutions as it lacks growth and dynamism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid forgetting things in life, adopt a sign-in-each-day approach, the constant and regular use of anything helps retain knowledge and wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me conclude with these wise words of comparison by the Hebrew writer&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Hebrews 5:12,14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! [14] But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The operative words are “ constant use”. Use your passwords regularly just as you'll read the bible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The goal is equality,</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul on his fundraising campaign for the brethren in Judaea made this his central theme, the interdependency of the church.&nbsp; He told the brethren at Corinth a well-endowed city of the need to assist the needy brethren in Judaea.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His argument is simple, no condition is permanent; today it is them (sic) tomorrow it will be you. The unfortunate truth is this exhortation has been forgotten, and has been replaced by the majority with selfishness!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of cooperating with each we are rather in competition with one another. Instead of sharing we are hoarding our blessings. Each wants to outshine the other.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proverbial “scratch my back so I scratch your back” though this has been used in the negative and derogatory sense; is what Paul’s appeal seems to suggest. Scratch my back today so I scratch yours tomorrow!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though we see around us the truth of this statement yet we are unable to embrace and apply it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mutual dependence is a natural law, every creation of God depends on each other to survive. Plants, animals and humans depend on nature’s provisions. Each provides support to the other. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That we need each other to survive is an undeniable truth. To avoid loneliness we make friends to provide us with fellowship! To help us improve our lives we engage the services of teachers or mentors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“No man is an island” is a poem written by John Donne, in which he stressed the interconnectivity of humanity.

Today may be a good time for you, but please time and circumstances change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Share today with others what you have so when your downturn comes they’ll extend a hand of help to you!

Some did, others failed. I was one of those who failed to comply!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was the era the Ayigbe carpenters ( Efo) introduced to the Ghanaian market the small wooden savings boxes. Yes, &nbsp;(Ayigbe Carpenters) to them belong the patent no one can deny that!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then came adulthood, and we had financial experts demonstrating to us financial plans that can make us financially sound and stable if we apply them. Many did, others failed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge of pursuing present gratification as against deferral has worried every youth, to this day it is still the number one hurdle to overcome. Interestingly, the Bible recommended long ago the deferral approach as the way to future joy and happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 13:12&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, gratification ( hope) deferred surely makes the heart sick, your friends are enjoying and you’ll love to do the same but choose not to because you want to invest for tomorrow!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is not how you start but how you end. You can have a good start but end up miserably. You can have a slow start but end up a winner. What passage of scripture does this bring to mind?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 9</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, exactly!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I must admit as a youth the thought of postponing gratification was a great challenge! What if “ tomorrow “ never comes to meet you ? This is the question that keeps popping up! When is the future?&nbsp;</p><p>We hear it said every day, but when is it?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, every day was once a future. Today was referred to yesterday as a future just as tomorrow is called a future today. Every day therefore is a future come real so do not think of a future as if it were a distant time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since man must live as is usually said what then must we do with regards to postponing today’s enjoyment to tomorrow? Must it be all or some? Here is a recommendation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>“ All work and no play made Oko an anti-social moron!&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a principle called “selective deferment”, by which is meant there are things that can and must of necessity be deferred whereas others can be enjoyed. What these are depends on your choices and goals in life! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you can defer early “marriage” to pursue the&nbsp; &nbsp;academic/training/apprenticeship etc, the same applies to entertainment here moderation is the word.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Make friends, associate with groups etc. but “abhor” certain groupings so you do not come into conflict with the law Always remember what scripture said;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 1:10-11,13-15&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[10] My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them. [11] If they say, “Come along with us; let's lie in wait for innocent blood, let's ambush some harmless soul;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[13] we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder; [14] cast lots with us; we will all share the loot ”--- [15] my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what is all this about? Defer ( postpone) the present for the future &nbsp; Deny yourself the present to enjoy the future. Yes, it will hurt, but that is the only way. to a better future. Use the present to lay a strong foundation for tomorrow&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However you define the future, it will surely come. Remember today was yesterday‘s future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A complex thought to share!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This is what should be in the church. Whereas civil society points to a constitution as the basis of determining right or wrong, the church points to the scriptures (the Bible).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If something is right or wrong by scripture, and it is so established and grounded in unambiguous terms; then that is what it is nothing can be done to make a right wrong or vice versa. Scriptures have spoken.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But where there is no such stated rule(s) we are left to fashion out our own rules however these must not be rigidly imposed or enforced. Acceptance and compliance are voluntary choices to the extent that each person sees them as they are.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We do this because there is no law, and where there is no law there is no sin. For it is through the law that we come to know what is sin. Sin is not defined by man, sin is not what man says it is, but what the scriptures say.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is in this context that the above scriptures must be understood,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 14:14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[14] I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As can be seen from the discussion, the controversy that Paul was addressing is the eating of meat, herbs etc.&nbsp; It looks like the contention was between vegetarians and non-vegetarians.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The issue was about liberty, Do Christians have liberty? Do we have any freedoms? This is a question nobody is asking! To most Christians there is nothing like liberty all is about the rule of law and the strict obedience without which you are not a Christian.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul’s statement “&nbsp; that nothing is unclean in itself.” Has to do with anything that the Scriptures have said nothing about. Surely, there are things that scriptures have designated as clean and unclean so if care is not taken to understand what Paul meant by putting this expression in context, we shall be making scripture to contradict itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a question of Christian liberty when it comes to things that are not mentioned and also in the absence of rules, or any thus saith the Lord; &nbsp; In such situations what should we do? &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is where we have the problem, whereas some would prefer not to do anything though there is no law, some think otherwise. So the conflict or controversy is between those who prefer to do nothing and those who prefer to do something!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By Paul’s logic, those who prefer to do nothing have not done anything wrong it is their choice. Likewise, those who prefer to do something have also not done any wrong except that they should take into account the feelings of the other group!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom line is that neither of these two groups has sinned. For where there is no law, there is no sin. To do or not to do anything where there is no law is a matter of the individual's choice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is important is that no one puts a stumbling block in the path of the other. Because each shall render account.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p><p>13+ Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our problem is one of knowing, acknowledging and understanding that ;&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Not everything is stated in black and white in the scriptures&nbsp;</li><li>There is something called Christian liberty&nbsp;</li><li>The practice of which is a matter of choice and not a force, it is voluntary&nbsp;</li><li>This liberty is practiced in matters that have nothing to do with salvation&nbsp;</li><li>In the practice of Christian liberty, each must be considerate and mindful of their actions, it’s impact on others.

    "text": "<p><strong>The Question Of Biographies And Tributes&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>John 20</p><p>KJV</p><p>30+ And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John 21</p><p>KJV</p><p>25+ And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wow, you’ll say but it is true. The Apostle John attempted to pen down as it were a biography of Jesus, along the way he realized how daunting such a task would be. Hence the conclusive statements you’ve just read.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These verses came to mind when I was tasked to write a biography of a loved one who lived up to a ripe old age ( age withheld for ethical reasons). I applied all the research skills I was taught in school but I found that one story leads to another. In the end, I had to give up and sum up in a few paragraphs the “life and times “ of Mr X.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What I learnt is this, the true entire biography of everyone can not be written on earth. I’ve been to funerals where brochures numbered several pages but still, they could not capture the entirety of the dead!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was confirmed by listening to as many as were at the funeral; each has a story to tell, an incident to describe, an admonition to recall. Yes!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our true biography can not be written here, it can only be written in Heaven. What we have written here are edited versions, some parts are removed, rephrased, rewritten etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can you imagine reading a biography of someone who lived up to a hundred in a little under ten or fifteen minutes? Yes, that is what you hear at funerals. Edited version.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, we are looking forward to that of Heaven where there will be no editing, it will be read as it is.&nbsp; That is what I’ll love to hear. The heavenly one has no lies, encomiums, exaggerations, garnishing etc. It does not aim at making a fool look wise, a wicked look good, a selfish look selfless&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yes! That day will be that day.! As Paul put it;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Corinthians 4:5&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[5] Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So beloved, worry not about what your biography would be or look like, that of the earth is edited, rephrased, and efforts will be made to paint you a saint or an angel when they know full well that is not the case!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A man known in his area as a no-nonsense husband; who often beat his wife, didn’t make her a top agenda but at his funeral; mourners were thrilled to hear what she wrote about him. , She wrote, “ he was a sweet loving man, he cared and provided for us OH! Hmmm, I miss him forever “! Yes you’ve heard this several times&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On one occasion I dared to ask why it is so? I was told that traditionally you don’t speak evil of the dead! Why? I received no answer! Will he come back to haunt you? Will he kill you? No one could answer. It's all a taboo design to let as it were “sleeping dogs lie” &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A dead person whether good or bad must be praised and be well spoken of! Yes. But not so in Heaven there a spade shall be called a spade. If in doubt just take any bible character of repute and read everything about him and you’ll know what heaven’s biography will look like!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a question of biography and tributes, no matter how lengthy or short they are, the true one shall be both written and read in Heaven. The reading may take much longer than what pertains here. Prepare for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is so much good about you that is not known, that Day will reveal them. Those who choose deliberately not to know or acknowledge you will hear it read by not a human being but an Angel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reading shall be interrupted intermittently by the sound of trumpets blown by Angels! After which a white robe shall be put over you, and you’ll majestically be led to take your seat by the Throne.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, what a glorious day awaits you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p><strong>Faith Moves Mountains; Wisdom Protects And Guides. Be A Patriot&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 9:14-15&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[14] There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. [15] Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up I heard much said concerning patriotism and how we should love and serve our country. During the Young Pioneer Movement days of Nkrumah, we the members of were taught this virtue -to love and serve the nation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A pledge was composed which was recited at every meeting of the Movement. Later over time, the Young Pioneer Movement spread to include schools and every child became a member. It first began with a select few.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A part of what we recited at our parades called the Code reads, “protection of state property, reliability and secrecy, comradeship and forbearance “ etc. It starts with the words “ I solemnly pledge to be faithful and loyal to the ideas ( ideals)&nbsp; of the founder of the nation, Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah etc. etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, patriotism was woven into our moral conscience from the Word go, but for the coup of 1966, Ghana would have been a haven of patriots. Nation-building was the goal, and it was nearly achieved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The above scriptures talk about an incident that according to Solomon was amazing, a city was saved by the wisdom of a poor man. A patriot you may call him. According to “ Uncle “ Solo he learnt two lessons that he will never forget, that is; the value and place of wisdom and patriotism, regardless of one’s economic status.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The city which was under siege was delivered through the wise advice this poor man gave. Something he did out of love for the city. Though we are not told what he said at least we know he was a man armed with ideas, know how etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hear Solomon;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 9:16&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These words seem to suggest that at the Town Hall meeting convened to discuss what to do; the majority were of the view that a “ boot for boot “ approach should be used.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the wise poor man got up to speak, he was likely heckled by the rich majority &nbsp; This can be gleaned from what Solomon said; Read it&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 9:17</p><p>NIV</p><p>[17] The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a subtle way of saying that whereas “ the majority of rich fools” were screaming their naïve solutions, the poor man spoke his wisdom in a low tone!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you not seen or experienced this before? Surely you have. Meetings where “ empty barrels” get up to scream incoherent, naïve etc ideas wanting to be heard just because they have a few socio/economic advantages!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom has nothing to do with what you wear, how you appear, the car you drive, the food you eat, the house you own, or the bed you sleep on. It has got to do with the quality of the contents of your head-brain!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your ability to think quality thoughts. Your ability to provide quality solutions to challenges, your ability to see what others can not see. Your ability to make sense of nonsense! Need I add more?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom is distilled knowledge, knowledge taken through the refinery of life. Tested and devoid of ambiguities and impurities of hazy, crooked thinking. Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom does not belong to the rich nor the poor, it is not the monopoly of a group. Wisdom is wisdom whoever desires it receives it. It is a gift.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>James 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>5+ If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The man in question was not wise because he was poor!&nbsp;</p><p>Poverty is a condition, a state, an economic and not a mental/intellectual deprivation! It is reversible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just as knowledge comes from books, so does wisdom come from God, every endowment has a source. There is divine wisdom and there is the secular they both have a part to play in human endeavours and are therefore necessary. Blessed is the man who possesses both, for he shall do wonders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because wisdom comes from God, He gives it to whomsoever He chooses, young or old, illiterate or literate, poor or rich, believer or non-believer etc; per what He wants accomplished!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Faith moves mountains, wisdom guides and protects we need both to be patriotic citizens of the kingdom of God, the Church of the Living&nbsp; God!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

If we make a choice that ends up in helping someone out of a predicament at a cost to us, this makes us selfless and pleases God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved this is not something you and I cannot do; some do it almost every day! You are one, if you care to know the last time you offered me a lift even though you were not going my direction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The last time you made me that tea using the last milk and teabag which you were going to use for yourself. ( This reminds me of the widow of Zarephath )&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The last time you saw me off with money you had intended to use for a pressing need, to buy fuel to take me home. Hardly did you know that you were laying down your life for my good.!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In doing these you are fulfilling what both Jesus and john said. Read that of John</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:16&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>( You read my article titled “ I want to know what love is!)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To Paul, this is what it means to walk in love. ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ephesians 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Jesus did these for our sakes, we also ought to do the same to ourselves ;</p><blockquote><p>John 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</p></blockquote><p><br>Be selfless, in making choices, factor in how the choice will inure to the good of others. There is so much selfishness parading as success in our midst. This is very subtle and is not easily discerned.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A word to the wise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Matthew 7</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the “christo-religious” foundation in Ghana is shaking under the weight of diviner’s and sorcerers parading as apostle’s and prophets to whom almost everyone educated or uneducated, politician or electorate, rich or poor, etc are turning to for succour.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most sought-after personalities today are Diviners (predictors/forecasters). People who can look into the future and predict gloom and doom, because good news does not attract it is the bad, so if you can predict gloom and doom then you are in business! Fear is the key factor!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A wave of change is blowing through the nation. True faith has come under threat, many are wavering, unsure of which is which, the country is at the crossroads. Developments are scary and extreme fear has gripped the populace&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The passages listed above speak volumes about the challenges faced by the early Christians. Diviners and sorcerers were present as they are today. The early believers were warned and told to expect these developments ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 Peter 2:1, 3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them-bringing swift destruction on themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[3] In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today majority are unable to identify divination and sorcery, as it was in the past so it is today many mistake it to be the power of God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The girl with the spirit of divination that Paul rebuked was not saying anything wrong. She was telling the truth&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Hear her;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Acts 16:16-17</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[17] She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read this? “We were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future”?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The KJV reads,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Acts 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two words worth noting: “divination and soothsaying “ &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The spirit of “ divination” enables the possessor to “ predict the future “Do you now understand what is meant by divination? There is a spirit which, when you possess you can predict the future. That is what we are reading from this verse!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The practice of Divination, involves the practitioner entering and peeping into the spiritual realm! A practice God forbade the Jews from engaging in. Divination and sorcery were part of a package that included other practices they were forbidden to practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Leviticus 20</p><p>KJV</p><p>6+ And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Deuteronomy 18:9-12&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[9] When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there</p><p>. [10] Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,&nbsp;</p><p>[11] or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. [12] Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord; because of these same detestable practices, the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether we believe it or not, there is a spiritual realm where invincible forces war against each other. It is a battle between good and evil. It is not a movie but a reality. Jesus knew this, and Paul was aware. Did he not say the following? Read a few ;&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 10</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds ;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At a point in His ministry, Jesus interceded for Peter when Satan planned for his downfall, read it&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 22</p><p>KJV</p><p>31+ And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p><p>32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The invincible unseen Hand of God surrounds us as such the evil hosts of Satan are unable to penetrate! We in leadership are his target, he will use every means possible, every little opening etc to derail our forward march! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, some church members are ready-made, willing tools in his hand to be used in executing his diabolical plans!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some spiritual hosts are arrayed against us, but at the same time, there are friendly hosts fighting on our behalf as Jesus did for Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is into this realm that diviners and sorcerers tap through satanic means to either alter, falsify, turn /change destinies etc. One such incident was what Jesus saw about Peter and aborted it. Satan was going to change his destiny!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is exactly what we see unfolding before our very eyes. People’s destinies are being changed and aborted in the spiritual realms! Unnatural phenomena are occurring because the arrangements in the spiritual realms have been infiltrated and tampered with!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Divination and sorcery are real! They are not imaginary or theoretical concepts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you recall this incident?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Samuel 28</p><p>KJV</p><p>11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? For thou art Saul.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>14+ And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some have doubted and denied this incident because they lack knowledge of the dark world. Unfortunately, these are those who fall prey to diviners because they lack knowledge regarding the practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spiritism, divination, soothsaying etc are real. There is the temptation to deny but they are real. We are forbidden to dabble in any of these practices&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Deuteronomy 29:29&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[29] The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This scripture acknowledges that there are “ secret things “ but they belong to God. He placed an embargo on His servants not to venture into such realms to look for etc anything He has “ classified “ which the writer referred to as “ secret “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same scripture also leaves in the Hands of God the right to “ declassify “ and whatever He “declassifies “ we will put it into the public domain. Whatever He declassifies is no secret!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if any claims to be a servant of God and yet ventures into such “secret realms “ when Hw has forbidden any to enter, then he is not a true servant of God, He is a disobedient servant, a fake or an imposter because he has disobeyed His directives&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a need for prayers and discernment, for the times are dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These may say “ God has revealed this or that to me” which is not true. What he claims is something he saw when he peeped into the secret forbidden realms!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed we are at a crossroads! Like Elymas some of these diviners/sorcerers sit at high places with rulers ( politicians ) &nbsp; &nbsp;They’ve made the rulers ( politicians ) to believe and endorse them as powerful men!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ghana is not a theocracy (spiritual) but a democracy (secular) both have different forms of governance structures and constitutions! These must be respected by the two institutions ( church and state ) and their operatives ( ministers and politicians )&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately for us, there is a drift by the operatives of the spiritual towards the secular, for whatever reasons your guess is as good as mine. Limelight, political favour and privileges!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are dangerous times, diviners and sorcerers are taking over true faith and practice, and by extension political governance as they seek to influence rulers and men in authority&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved as the psalmist of old requested so do I today ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalm 122:6-7&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[6] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you be secure. [7] May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels. ”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was amazed by this response from the Canaanite mother who came to plead on behalf of her daughter who was experiencing some spiritual challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus wanted to test her faith by saying what may be regarded today as an unpleasant comment. Read it.&nbsp;</p><p>22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p><p>24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>25+ Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p><p>26+ But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read this?</p><p>Matthew 15:26&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[26] He replied, “It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dogs? Just because I’ve come to seek help? Oh no!!&nbsp; Surely this is enough to put away anyone making a plea or a request, as it sounds offensive but not this woman.!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read her response&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 15:27&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[27] “Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She did not doubt what Jesus said but she also gave a profound response, a response that touched the heart of Jesus. She said, “ master, with all due respect in case you’ve forgotten, let me remind you, even the crumbs that fall from the table are delicacies to dogs!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Please note, she said these while smiling! Not in a combatant disrespectful manner!)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this saying of her’s Jesus had no option but to yield to her request. He understood and interpreted her response as an expression of faith. Read it;</p><p>Matthew 15:28&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[28] Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is victory through perseverance! This woman instead of walking away stood her ground, regardless of how provocative Jesus’ answer to her was, she stood her ground!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, regardless of what the negatives are or may be; stand your ground until your request is granted. See these negatives as a test of your &nbsp;resolve.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was young and TV sets were not very common, so we often trooped to watch one in a house where we were not entertained! Our parents could not afford one so we were treated as outcasts!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At six pm every evening we would go to watch Bonanza,(?) featuring Dan Blocker, Pernell Roberts and also The Saint etc. &nbsp;We would be accused of not taking our baths therefore we are smelling! &nbsp;We were not allowed to cross a demarcated zone even though the TV set was placed outside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes. All manner of insults would be rained on us, with strict restrictions among which is not to talk, laugh or shout! Reader, who watches an exciting film without engaging in any of these? But these were the rules. The intent was to make things intolerable so we quit!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like the woman mentioned above, we stood our ground regardless of the provocations and insults because we wanted to enjoy ourselves! We were focused, we defied all odds to remain and watch the TV. We never walked away.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Poverty teaches lessons, &nbsp;one such lesson is perseverance. This we learnt from our youth due to the circumstances we found ourselves in. Little did we know we were preparing ourselves to face the challenges in life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear reader, regardless of provocations, no matter the unpleasant comments, ‘go and comes’ (sic) that may be thrown in your path; persevere for they are the trials of your faith and patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do not walk away from the prize before you because of insults, stand your ground and victory will be yours. Always remember, “no thorns no crown! “If you can wear the crown of thorns, you’ll have no difficulty wearing that of gold!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Paul said ;&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we must go through hazards to win a victory, this is a principle of life we can not escape but must experience. The Canaanite woman walked away after receiving a commendation from Jesus. “ Great is Thy Faith !”&nbsp; This can also be said of you, Great is your perseverance!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

As it is with the good, so with the sinful; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though we differ in many respects, pursue different ideals and goals in life one thing is common to us all, death.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No matter what are status’ is in life we have one thing in common; death, as was said to Adam our great-grandfather; “ from the dust you were taken and to dust shall thou return “.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This we see every day as we visit the cemetery where coffins containing the mortal remains of people who once lived, ate, laughed, etc with lowered into a pit dug for them and covered with soil and in a split moment vanish from our sight for good!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As has also been said, these take nothing they possessed away; “ we brought nothing into the world and we shall certainly take nothing away “. Nothing In, Nothing Out!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything we own here is on a rental basis, they don’t belong to us, even our bodies are rented properties! At the appropriate time when our tenancy runs out the owner takes His properties back.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone entering the world at birth signed a tenancy agreement, interestingly this agreement is not physical but spiritual. It is deposited with the Landlord no copy is given to us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly.

One thing is clear, He does not abrogate the contract/tenancy, He allows it to run its full course! Any abrogation is not His but man-initiated. So be careful you don’t initiate any process that will abrogate your tenancy agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again we the tenants can not Influence Him.

When, we don’t know this weekend we are seeing many off since their tenancies have expired!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us be wise with how we live, we are living on borrowed time so every second matters!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It varies from person to person, but simply it is any permanent inconvenience that puts limitations on enjoying your total freedom!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many have certain limitations that they’ve worried themselves about, they’ve spent so much fortune to have them removed but to no avail.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are not alone, Paul was like that. Three times he petitioned God, but to no avail. However, unlike us, he resolved and resigned his will to God. Read what he wrote,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p><p>9+ And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. “Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities”, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, accept your “ cross “ live with it and enjoy life. Your worries will not change anything! I have a metal implant in my right arm, and it’s been there since 1989! Truly a “ thorn in my flesh” there is nothing I can do about &nbsp;it but to live with it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My grace is sufficient for thee was not said only to Paul, but by extension also to us who are in situations similar to his.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore beloved, avoid self-pity.

Yet we can not say it in the open but only in private! Basically to avoid “ trouble !”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what is it that made them “ foolish?”! The context provides the answer! Read it; to learn and avoid such mistakes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you see? They did not plan. They did not think it through. They did not anticipate! They did not project.! They did not envisage! It was these that conferred on them the unfortunate title /description “ foolish!”!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Am sure after reading these some names/friends etc came to mind! You know some just as I also do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this category are found people with weak minds, people who accept /believe etc things on face value. People who follow some for the sake of it! People who put their trust explicitly in others without thinking for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Marxist terminology, they are called the “ lumpen-proletariat “. The working class that places its absolute trust in its leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve ever read George Orwell’s novel “ The Animal Farm” you’ll come across a horse called “ Boxer”!&nbsp; Yes! He worked tirelessly because he believed in&nbsp; Napoleon and the rest as always being right. Only to be disappointed in the end!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today we have the same in our fellowship, secular (political)&nbsp; or divine ( church ) where some place absolute trust in leadership! Forgetting that they are also human, flesh and blood.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our case, some do this to gain favour, to be in the good books of leaders, what we would call blind followership for selfish interests' sake. Even though they see and know what is wrong they’ll not speak out!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are not only “ foolish “ but also “hypocritical”. Wherever they outnumber the wise you can be sure of failure in that setup be it secular or divine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does the description /tile “foolish” fit the weak-minded followers, but equally fits some in leadership! Yes. These are those who play politics with the Truth by turning a blind eye to the truth! Unfortunately, there are many!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like secular leadership, these love/crave the support offered by the weak-minded in society or church; the human “Boxers ” Of the Animal Farm drama of George Orwell! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After serving in the ministry for over half a century I have seen these unfortunate developments at work! Wherever you turn to in life, there will always be the “ five were wise and five were foolish “!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the “foolish” we shall have with us always.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My revisit to the parable, lessons I learnt these I share with you!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Our mission was simple to “chase the girls” in that community.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, you read it! Years we spent in vanity and pride, caring not that Jesus died, knowing not it was us He died at Calvary. Now we know!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We knew very well that the “ area boys” would resist and fight us but we trusted in our numbers. That was Accra then, areas such as Adabraka, Osu were our targets!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We go out with the mindset that our collective strengths will work wonders for us, and it did in most cases except for a few.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same mindset, the collective will; is what the above scriptures are teaching us, that whatever we wish, if we pool our spiritual strengths we shall record success because it receives Divine approval.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is where we’ve failed as a people. The foundational theology teaches that this was said to the apostles and since we are not it does not apply in our time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we are not “apostles “ but the “principle” remains the same. Pool individual spiritual resources together and you attain results as it will certainly receive Divine approval. Period!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is on this basis that we offer collective congregational prayers for the sick, the needy, the oppressed etc seeking relief and recovery for them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What we lose on earth is loosed in Heaven, what we bind is bound These scriptures inspired the all-night prayer sessions that many engaged in with resounding results!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The “spiritual poverty” of the church lies in her failure to understand this very verse of scripture! Our prayers are nothing but “ ma tra makwèî”. “Try and see,” it is not based on faith.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well as Jesus said, “ as your faith is so be it unto you !”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is spiritual strength and power in the collective. Whatever they bind is bound, whatever they loosen is loosed. This is a divine privilege that many have denounced.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our case, we pray without certainty whereas we are told to pray with certainty.&nbsp; Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>Mark 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read this&nbsp;</p><p>Mark 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>24+ Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you get what this verse says? Ask ( pray) with certainty “ believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them!”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, what a privilege we’ve forfeited!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We must encourage collective prayer sessions since this is the way we can pool spiritual power to bind and loosen anything, this shall receive divine approval!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Some inherit it, others search for and work for it!

If someone you call a friend treats you casually, know that he/she never looked for you. He/she does not desire you as a friend. To him, you are an acquaintance and not a friend.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is nothing wrong with being an acquaintance, it is a relationship; just that it is a low-level relationship.&nbsp; And take note, low-level relationships come with low-level commitments! Do not expect much from such a relationship. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, a friendship that is treasured and highly valued is seen through the treatment one receives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a relationship of high commitment to each other. Read this example,&nbsp;</p><p>Ruth 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you see the difference?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is it not in affliction or in adversity that we know who our true friends are?

They are seen as the pillars of the Movement and discussing this incident may do damage to the high esteem in which they are held.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though we all agree that it was recorded to teach us, we are simply afraid of examining it. In my view, we can discuss it from the objective point of view. Each of the two men had reasons for splitting from the other.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at the scenario ;</p><p>36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>37+ And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p><p>38+ But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, they were united on the fact that there was the need to go revisit the brethren they had brought to the faith.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, the contention was about who should go with them, the Team! Barnabas felt that the Team should be made up of the original members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His reason(s) may be that these are men who already have some experience in mission work so they’ll not need to recruit and train as if they were new members. This could take time hence delaying the scheduled time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A cogent reason!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul would likely have agreed to this suggestion of Barnabas his fellow traveller. It was the mention and inclusion of John Mark, that triggered the conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul’s argument was, No he left and returned hence there is no need to take him along”. He further asked,” bro what is the guarantee that he will not repeat the same act?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite Barnabas’ assurances Paul stood his ground not yielding an inch. As a result, they parted company! Now let us look at the factors that could have influenced Paul’s decision&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He indeed argued from facts, John Mark left to return home. Barnabas on the other hand was of the view that he could be pardoned as a “ young man” who at the time was immature!”&nbsp; This is also a fact.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>5+ And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>13+ Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So in matters of fact, they both were correct; the other thing that influenced their decisions was “ emotion” and this was the main cause! Yes, emotion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Factual decisions, that is decisions based on facts don’t divide, it is rather the emotional! And this is exactly what took place. Read it again;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 15:39 NIV</p><p>[39] They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decisions made by both were influenced by their respective emotions! How do I know, you may ask? After many years when tension was down and tempers cooled, Paul asked for Mark to be brought to him! Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Timothy 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read this “ he is profitable to me for the ministry?” Paul’s Words.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isn’t it the same among us? Factual interpretation of scriptures does not divide us, it is our opinions ( emotional) about a verse /passage etc that divides us. Most uphold and defend their opinions despite the facts pointing to the contrary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my line of duty, I’ve encountered many such conflicts. Whereas I argue and decide based on facts, others argue and decide based on emotional considerations of issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, they are able to sway many ( the emotionalists ) to believe in their emotional decisions only to regret. Both Paul and Barnabas parted company not on the facts but on emotional grounds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anytime there is a conflict, when you trace the source you’ll come to one; emotional decisions were made. Wherever and whenever emotion and not reason are high, conflicts are bound to arise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And because emotions are difficult to control and bring down conflicts in whatever form ( wars, hostilities, quarrels, division ) etc continue&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What makes things worse is that to every emotion there is a name and a face called “ pride and shame”. It is these two that pose the challenge, they sustain and support emotional conflicts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is only one medication that cures them, it is called “ maturity “. I believe Paul and Barnabas took it hence Paul’s invitation to Mark to come and join him!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How do I know of Barnabas? Well, John Mark definitely would have to talk things over with his “uncle” Barnabas before accepting to join Paul.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Decisions based on facts don’t divide they unite. It is decisions based on emotions that divide because they fail to see reason!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is why “ in the midst of fools, it is foolishness to be wise !”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8+ And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some have asked, did Abraham lie to Isaac or did he know God would not let him down? Was he by this answer to Isaac expressing his absolute trust, confidence and faith in God? I leave you to answer for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abraham was at the crossroads, the promised child had been born and not long he was asked to offer him as a sacrifice! It was a moment of mental agony and torment! But Abraham did not waver. Why?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us cross-examine him, what compelling evidence did he have hence he did what he did? What stands out is faith. But what is faith?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From this definition, we know that faith is not blind but is based on “ evidence “! But what evidence does Abraham have? To cut a long story short, he has walked with God since he left his hometown; and has experienced the hand of God in many ways so he knew the God he was dealing with!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He left his fate in the hands of God! Beloved, there comes a time in life when all you can do is to leave everything in the hands of God. At the crossroads in Gethsemane Jesus left his fate in the hands of God when he said&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 22</p><p>KJV</p><p>42+ Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There comes a time when humanely speaking you’ve exhausted every known answer, avenue, solution etc but still things remain the same. Like Abraham, like Jesus resign your will to God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like Abraham you’ve also walked with God for many years now, you’ve known at least how in your darkest hours He brought you “salvation” from nowhere. Trust Him to do it again.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abraham knew what God could do, hence the answer he gave to Isaac.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Genesis 22:8 NIV</p><p>[8] Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you come to the crossroads, do not panic commit the situation or circumstance to God. Stand still and watch, you’ll see the hand of God moving to restore calm to your restless mind!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 26</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>3</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I write I am at a crossroad, I’ve done all that is possible but the situation remains unchanged I’ve decided to let go so God take control. Human reasoning has a limit, where it ends that’s where faith starts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we shall fear no evil! Greater is He who is in us than who is outside. By faith,&nbsp; we like Abraham shall overcome to His glory.

Measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise !”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unhealthy, egoistic. Opportunistic rivalry you name it; has no place in the church of the Living God yet our assemblies are filled with these negatives. Sisters comparing themselves with themselves; brothers comparing themselves with themselves!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These comparisons would have been greatly appreciated had they been in things spiritual; unfortunately, they are all in the material.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The church at Corinth comes to mind when we talk about rivalry, as a result of self-comparison! The church was riddled with rivalry so much so that Paul had to step in to stop it! Today we see the same spirit manifesting itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding sisters, it is who is more beautiful, dresses more cutely than the other, and has more fans as if beauty is forever, as if the church is a fashion parade! Just look at how “crumbled” your face and skin look today compared with how they looked a few years ago! Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My dear, no matter how much makeup you put in, they rather make you look weird than real. Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The late AB Crentsil in his evergreen song which I often listen to titled; “ Ye Wô A Dè OYè” made this remark about youthful girls who compare and boast of themselves. “ Bobby stand, back tyres are loose”. Yes! Such was many an old woman of yesterday! But how do they look today? A pale shadow!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is vain if not foolish to compare oneself to another. Everything about us is in transition, beauty fades! We are rendered valueless, as we age with time. Indeed, our greatest enemy is time!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the 70’s there was this popular song titled “Growing Old” A line reads “ I wish I’ll never grow old!” May we learn not to compete or compare ourselves with each other, these are vanities and create hatred and enmity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be happy and content with who you are. You are unique there is none like you. Be proud of who you are do not trade it for who or what someone else looks like!!! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for me, I am in my own class! So you too, be in your own class, do not compare yourself with or to anybody. If you do as Paul said, you are not a wise person!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In life, there will always be someone higher or lower than you. Be yourself, if some does not like or love you, simply tell them “ they can go to hell and greet the devil, you don’t give a hoot!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 10:12&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves.

Selah.</p><p>4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This morning, in a chat with a sister, we both acknowledged the day as a gift and wished each other a blessed day. But before then came the question, “How do we spend a gift?” What use?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How beneficial a gift is depends on us. We’ve just received a gift of 24 hours! Before it expires at midnight today find out what you’ve been able to do with it.&nbsp; Do this with a pen in hand and paper by your side. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, these are questions many have never thought of nor asked themselves! Is it not true that most don’t put to good use any gift they received? When I was a student in the UK, there were county newspapers that advertised sales of goods. Some advertisers list goods they are offering for sale as “ unwanted gift!”&nbsp; Simply they don’t know what to do with them!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our case, some of the gifts we receive are left to collect dust on tables, kitchens etc. If they are clothes they are left on hangers in wardrobes unused.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today is a gift what will you do with it? What you do with it will determine your future. Remember, today is what yesterday you called tomorrow! You had plans for it, therefore put them into action today!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To help you manage gifts here is what I do. Whenever I receive a gift I sit back and think about what to do with it to improve my life! I think through to find out how best the gift can help me achieve a goal-add value to my life. This is what every gift we receive should be seen and regarded.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is the proper and appropriate use of a gift that enhances life which we call a blessing. If today which is a gift will be a blessing to you then think and plan how to use it. Do this before you step out, make a list of priorities and see them through.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve been doing this for years and I have found it extremely helpful. I therefore recommend this approach to you. Make the most out of every day.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy the gift of Today. While doing so please do not forget the Giver.

Etc. Some of these messages are what we call “ kutia “ in twi! I leave the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But my attention was drawn to the above scriptures when I received a gift from someone I found difficult to remember, as it has been several years since we met. He took time to replay memories and finally, I got him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He told me how things I’ve said and taught have brought him great blessings over the years. He has tried to reach out to me with difficulty because he does not have my contact information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truly I was humbled to hear him recount his experiences and attributed them to things he heard and learnt from me. It was then that this trotro inscription came to mind “ good never lost!”&nbsp; I don’t know if it is good English but it was very commonly used then&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, “ good never lost” that is what happened to Rahab. The same happened to the widow of Zarephath and several others that time and space will not allow me to list.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some have sent me money, items of great value etc because of what they have benefited from me in time past. I ask God’s abundant blessings upon these benefactors. In the darkest hours of my life, these have always extended hands of grace!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, cast thy bread upon the waters “ is indeed true advice which if obeyed will inure to our good. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are the equivalents of the blind man who returned to thank Jesus! Like Jesus asked, so also do I “Where are the nine?” It may include you the reader.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me conclude with the popular proverb “Those who drink from a Well they did not dig, should never forget those who dug it”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to all my benefactors!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>How To Speak So As Not To Be Called A Liar</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 4:25</p><p>NIV</p><p>[25] Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A simple instruction but very difficult to obey and apply. This instruction holds the key to a fruitful social interaction among friends or brothers of the same family-church!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve listened to many speak or say things only to be called liars, which is a strong derogatory term to describe a friend or a brother! But how did it get to that point? That is what this article intends to address.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We begin by asking what it means to speak “ falsely ?” It is to communicate or to speak, say things etc; without facts or evidence to support what one says. The opposite of this is to speak “ truthfully” A truthful statement is one based on facts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To speak from assumptions, to exaggerate, to speculate, to conjecture etc are all part of what can be described as speaking falsely, simply because they are not facts!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Assumptions, exaggerations, speculations etc are personal commentaries; there is nothing wrong with them, everyone has the right to express their views on a matter or subject. What is wrong is to affirm them as the truth and they must be obeyed by all</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, to avoid being classified or labelled as a “liar” when you speak from any of the above-listed, it is highly recommended that you begin your statements/presentations etc, with a “disclaimer”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A disclaimer stating that in” your considered view or opinion here is what you think”&nbsp; Let the audience know that what you are about to say is an assumption or deduction! This will help them know and understand your conclusions as “opinions”.&nbsp;</p><p>And indeed opinions they are and not a lie or falsehood because you’ve earlier issued a disclaimer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that there are all types of “ opinions !”&nbsp; We have “ learned/educated opinions “ “ unlearned/, emotional opinions” fanatical opinions “ exaggerated opinions, consistent/inconsistent opinions! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like how Paul labelled and cautioned against entertaining some questions; maybe we may have to apply the same to some “opinions” so we avoid entertaining /commenting on some forms /types of opinions! Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>2 Timothy 2</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>23</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is when you did not issue any disclaimer but spoke as if they were facts, when what you said is found later to be untrue that is when you are a liar, because you’ve spoken falsely!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If what you say, teach, etc are accepted as “ opinions “ when the real facts are known you can change your views or opinions without any difficulty! You’ll win the respect of your hearers. This is maturity but where despite the facts you still hold to your “ opinions “ and proclaim them to be true then you will be labelled a liar!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This, beloved is a “disease” that has afflicted the majority! They have taught things that are based on assumptions, opinions etc now, in the light of the facts and evidence they still hold and believe their “ opinions” to be true!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An unfortunate development!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is wrong with admitting that something said/taught/believed etc in the past was wrong? One word describes such a stand or position; pride. And read ;&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>18+ Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 18</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 29</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when confronted with facts and indisputable evidence may we eat our humble pie. Facts are sacred, opinions are free. In matters of faith ( facts ) unity , in matters of opinion , liberty. This 18th century</p><p>Common sense approach to unity is still valid&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let each express and hold fast to his opinions, he must also allow others to do the same. None must impose his opinions on any unless he believes and shares in the same opinions!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truth unites, opinions divide. Opt for the Truth so you can unite.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 4:25</p><p>NIV</p><p>[25] Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

I do so as a tribute to the many who taught me how to read and write. Without them, you’ll not read what you are reading from me!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After every school holiday, we were made to write a “ composition” with the topic&nbsp; “ How I spend My Holiday “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simple as it sounds but difficult to some of us! Why? Because we went nowhere, we sat here in Accra! But we were forced to write what we did anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, I realized this was where and when I discovered my creative writing skills that later improved with time as I climbed the educational ladder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have to imagine and create an interesting scene worth sharing! Unfortunately, there will be no such creative or imaginary scenes to be written about when our “ spiritual excursion “ is over.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is what Paul meant when he wrote ;</p><p>2 Corinthians 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>10+ For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So my dear reader, enjoy your excursion do what you like, go where you want or wish to go! No one will write or mark your “ composition “. It is you who will write and it is God who will mark!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you’ll pass or fail will depend on what you write and the Examiner-God. No elder, deacon, evangelist etc, will be asked to comment on your paper. The Examiner knows you better than they! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>None of them can influence the Examiner or the marking scheme in your favour! There it will be “ everybody for himself, God for us all”. So begin trying your hand in the way your “composition” will look like. Live in such a way as to write with no regrets.! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember the topic “ How I spend My years on Earth!”&nbsp; We are on an excursion let us enjoy the trip!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read how someone wrote his ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Years I spent in vanity and pride,</p><p>Caring not my Lord was crucified,</p><p>Knowing not it was for me He died</p><p>On Calvary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chorus:</p><p>Mercy there was great, and grace was free,</p><p>Pardon there was multiplied to me,</p><p>There my burdened soul found liberty -</p><p>At Calvary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How will you start yours?

It is not about how many people you have surrounding you, it is about the quality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quality joy, quality happiness, is not a direct function of the many but the few that surround you. A man with fewer but sincere and genuine friends is better off than one with many hypocrites around</p><p>It is not about “ fans” but “ family “ Of trusted people!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I lived in England I noticed strangely though how some are passionate about keeping animals as friends. Dogs wear specially sewn cover coats, eat good food, and sleep in the same bed with their owners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, I was stunned and wondered why. It was later when l threw myself wholly into the ocean of humans and saw the infighting, bickering, Envy, jealousy, gossip etc that I realized how wise these men are.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dogs and cats don’t gossip, they don’t betray their masters, they are faithful and loyal to them! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These men kept a few genuine friends with whom they shared and enjoyed their lives. They shut out noise so they can listen to quality chat and conversation. Sika mpè dedè! Quality enjoyment is not about noise but serenity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you asked why few play or watch golf while the majority play or watch football? There are differences in enjoyment! Come to think of it, when you die how many people will we need to carry your coffin? 4!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be blunt, the more people you have in your life the more problems and challenges you face. The fewer the quieter and lesser the problems and challenges! This is not selfishness but peace of mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, if some throws you out of their company rejoice and be thankful. Our desire is to be found in the company of a few sincere and genuine friends. If you find such people don’t let them go!&nbsp; I’m looking for them!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought.&nbsp;</p>",

You’ll hear these say “ Oh next year I’ll buy this or do this or that then I will look like this or that”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To them it is all about the future, their twi slogan is what we’ve all heard since birth “ ebè yè yiè “ which never comes to be.&nbsp;</p><p>( Dreamers, fantasizers)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then there is the group that live their lives on a daily basis, these take on any challenge that comes their way without dwelling on or making comparisons/references etc to the past, nor postponing to another date or time called “ future.”</p><p>( Pragmatists)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the state in which you find yourself today indicates which of the three periods listed above you are living in. Your spiritual, social, economic etc state is a function of the time you live your life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you live in the past you’ll always be frustrated and disappointed with the present so much so that you’ll practically do little to nothing!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you live in the future, you’ll be doing nothing concrete today but delight in daydreaming. You’ll be thinking of a non-existent “future”; forgetting that each day is the future!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, you called today tomorrow which is the future that has come! There is no day or month called “ future” each day, each month etc is the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you live in the present the chances of making things happen and thus living a satisfied life are very high. You don’t postpone nor do you look back. Each day you take the bull by the horns, if it must be done then it is today and not tomorrow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What Jesus said is do not live in the future, live in the present, tackle today’s problems and challenges! If there is any tomorrow, it begins from today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is today that lays the foundation for tomorrow! A poor foundation today will guarantee you a poor tomorrow! So focus on today so that tomorrow will take care of itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again,</p><p>Matthew 6:34 NIV</p><p>[34] Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please remember He did not say “ don’t think” but “ don’t worry “&nbsp; there is a difference!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Songs, Hymns Of Memory:.What I Remember!&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 10</p><p>KJV</p><p>7+ The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Memories of good people, events, occasions and times flash through our minds very often but we are too busy to pause and reflect on them! I took time to reflect on one such memory here is how I felt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I happened to visit a church a few weeks ago, and during the worship service, a few old familiar hymns were sung! These were sung continuously, and the impact and effect they had on me made me stop singing and stand still!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Memories of the past began to rush through my mind I started seeing faces and moods of people who were with me when these songs were sung many years ago Unfortunately, though a few are alive the majority are no more. They’ve gone home!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know about you, but with me, songs in general ( spiritual or secular ) bring back memories whenever I hear them played or sung. They situate me precisely in time,&nbsp; place and the occasion! I often pause to relive and enjoy them. Something I highly recommend.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Such occasions made me feel young and it uplifts my spirit!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a Ghanaian version of Handel’s messiah which we called locally “ Hallelujah chorus” which was popularly sung in the 80s! When I hear it sung today (though a pale shadow of itself,) it brings back sweet memories of fellowship!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel the same when I hear some of the secular pop songs of the ‘60s and ‘70s they take me back to my youthful days.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The likes of Otis Redding,( I’ve Got Dreams!) Sam Cooke ( Chain Gang) Percy Sledge ( When A Man Loves A Woman) Wilson Pickett ( Midnight Hour) James Brown ( Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag) etc. not forgetting ABBA ( Super Trouper 80s)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Songs, hymns etc, be they spiritual or secular bring back memories I shared with friends I hope the same applies to you. They help revive and renew bonds of friendship long forgotten! I remember picking up my phone to call a friend after hearing an old song we both enjoyed in our youth!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So next time you hear a hymn or song let it remind you of the friendship, joy and happiness we shared sometime ago. The good times we shared, the love and admiration we had for each other before misunderstandings and foolishness “ parted us” Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us do this as quickly as we can because our departure time is here! Soon our flight will be announced, how prepared are we?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I conclude with what Paul wrote;</p><p>Romans 8:35,37-39&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[35] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[37] No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[38] For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[39] neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let nothing separate us, remember the good old days and times we shared! The fun, the laughter, the journeys we took together, the rides, the food we shared as we ate together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>O! Memories! Let us relive them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Comforting And Consoling Words: They Are Not Solutions<br>James 2<br>KJV<br>15+ If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br>16 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was having a conversation with someone about an article I wrote on “condolences. “In that article, I made the point that “condolences “ are mere words expressing the wishes and thoughts of the sender. They are not solutions to the challenges faced by the bereaved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The thoughts I expressed are what James has also captured in the verses you’ve just read! Comforting and consoling words are not the solution to any problem, need, or challenge faced by anybody!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They are what they are “ comforting and consoling!”Words.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What James is saying is, to put it bluntly “ Words don’t fill the stomach of a hungry man, Words don’t put cloth on a naked man!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Words have their time and place, they act as “ soothing balm “ to a wounded person but are not the cure. It is like saying “ I am sorry “ to someone you’ve hurt or wronged. As I’ve written before, sorry does not heal or correct the wrong it only soothes the pain inflicted by the wrong done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved it is important we draw the line between words and actions. Actions we are told, speak louder than words. This is not to say words don’t “ speak” they do, but “actions” speak much louder, and it is the loudest sound that people hear and pay attention to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many a time, members bring their requests /problems/challenges etc to the church, seeking solutions; all they get is “ comforting and consoling Words “these are expressed or communicated through prayers!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the very scene James described above, he probably may have observed a congregation &nbsp;at a midweek prayer session! Two members stood up to mention their needs or predicaments.&nbsp;<br>And as usual, brother Q was asked to pray for them! And it ended there!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Brethren in Christ, &nbsp;let us wake up to the Realities Of Truth, there are many suffering from the disappointments we have inflicted on them by only speaking “ comforting and consoling “ Words To Them in their hour of need devoid of any action whatsoever</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A concern to raise! A solution to share! A charge to keep I have. My calling to fulfil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He who hath ears to hear let him hear! Soon we shall all stand in the witness box to be cross-examined, so put your Acts together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
