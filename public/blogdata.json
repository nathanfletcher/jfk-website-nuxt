    "text": "<p>A Cautionary Advice To A Young Friend</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>17+ The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us the aged have for friends some young men and women. Occasionally we meet and interact, and we tell one another “What was and &nbsp;what is!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generations differ no one doubts this, however, some principles don’t change with generational change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rate at which societal values are changing has been a source of worry and concern to the older generation! In a conversation with a young friend, this issue came up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The conclusion we both came up with was “ somebody ( a generation) went to sleep” A generation failed to uphold and pass on to the other what it received. It is this failure that has brought us to where we are today! The question was How do we then reset the clock?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see and experience these in every sphere of life be it social, church, family or national. Had the failed generation followed the principle of transferring to others what it received we would have maintain high moral and ethical standards and sanity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the Church we have kept and observe the Lord’s Supper because, as Paul said ;&nbsp;</p><p>Corinthians 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have passed on to us values that have kept past generations sound, united, responsive and respectful. Today all these have crumbled before our very eyes. This is a laissez-faire generation!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sages of old have always held as sacrosanct this commandment;</p><p>Proverbs 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>8+ My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</p><p>2+ Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do we see today?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, the “old order changeth”, but eternal laws/principles, truths etc remain the same. These are what is called the “ eternal non-negotiable principles and laws”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of which is respect for the elderly, in whom reside refined quality thought, wisdom and common sense as a result of experience gathered through life!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If only we could all pay attention to this warning, our journey would be smooth and end well! &nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 20</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every generation was once a youthful generation, blessed are those who recognize that progress and success lie in the degree and extent to which they treat those who were before them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything is an inheritance, a transference from one generation to the other. What have you inherited? And from whom? Your deeds etc will reveal what you inherited and from whom!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eyes are watching l!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The contents of a wicked heart are seen through deeds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a heart that conceives, plans and executes evil as if it were for fun! A wicked heart is a heart that rejoices and stands aloof when others suffer. It is self-centred.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also a heart full of vengeance, that knows no forgiveness unless he has paid back evil with evil. It is a vindictive heart!

Very skillful in their choices of words either spoken or written. It is always a delight to hear them speak or read what they write</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To speak therefore is the same as to write with a pen, &nbsp;one is audible the other silent, they all have the same audience!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Words spoken or written can be classified into two categories: wise and unwise. They can make or break the spirit of their hearers or readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore heed this admonition;&nbsp;<br>Proverbs 25<br>KJV<br>11+ A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p><p>Proverbs 15:23&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[23] A person finds joy in giving an apt reply---and how good is a <strong>timely word</strong>!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Timely words </strong>are very important, read how Isaiah puts it ; &nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 50<br>KJV<br>4+ The Lord God hath given me the <strong>tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season</strong> to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.<br><br>Words whether spoken or written live forever in the minds of both hearers and readers. Their effects may be forgiven or forgotten but not the words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a practical note, I’ve had many referring me to things I’ve said or written before. Some in context others taken out of context!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to note that the words we speak or write will be recalled on the Day of Judgment as testimonies for or against us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 12<br>KJV<br>36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p><p>37+ For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p><p>James also warned ;&nbsp;</p><p><br>James 3:1-2&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[1] Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.</p><p>[2] We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, beloved choose your words, do your best to let them be appropriate and relevant to the occasion. Be measured and economical in the use of words; either spoken or written.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tongue is a pen, use it wisely! In writing we think through before we put any word on paper, in like manner train your tongue to weigh words before they are uttered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The careless use of words has caused many a relationship, either friendship or marriage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe</p>",

    "text": "<p><br>Acts 1<br>KJV<br>11+ Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was said many centuries ago and has remained the main hope and expectation of all believers!&nbsp;<br>Can it truly be said that we await with preparation and expectation, &nbsp;His second coming? &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When was the last time you heard a sermon on The Second Coming? It has been assumed and therefore pushed to the back burner. This explains why the faith of many has grown cold because they’ve lost appetite for heaven. Hmmm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rereading these scriptures brought to mind the famous statement often heard at the end of every Fu Manchu film series from the lips of popular actor Christopher Lee, aka Fu Manchu!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our youth (1960/70) we watched a series of films depicting a notorious underworld figure called Fu Manchu. Though at the end of every series he would be caught, yet before the film is brought to a close he would appear and utter the words “ the world shall hear of me again”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As naive as we then were, this statement from Fu Manchu frightens us because we see him appear in another episode; we often wonder how he could reappear after his death! Truly, It is great to be young!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reading what the angel told the disciples should remind us that &nbsp;“&nbsp;<br>this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This means Jesus will return in a physical form and not as a spirit as some claim and will be seen by all! What is unknown is the when! The ‘how’ we know, the ‘where He will come from’ &nbsp;we know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you thought about this? On that day a great mystery shall be solved as we shall see Him as He is! Whether white, black, yellow-skinned etc we don’t know. That day and hour shall declare! Truly we look forward to that day and His appearance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, since we don’t know the “when” let each be always ready so His return does not take him/her unaware. The question that should be of great concern &nbsp;is where will He find us? In what state or condition? Peaceful or angry, loving or hating? Etc. Think about this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This question worried Fanny J Crosby (1820-1915) &nbsp;a blind songwriter which led her to write this hymn ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jesus comes to reward His servants,<br>Whether it be noon or night,<br>Faithful to Him will He find us watching,<br>With our lamps all trimmed and bright?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Oh, can we say we are ready, brother?<br>Ready for the soul’s bright home?<br>Say, will He find you and me still watching,<br>Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2<br>If at the dawn of the early morning,<br>He shall call us one by one,<br>When to the Lord we restore our talents,<br>Will He answer thee—Well done?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3<br>Have we been true to the trust He left us?<br>Do we seek to do our best?<br>If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,<br>We shall have a glorious rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4<br>Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching,<br>In His glory they shall share;<br>If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,<br>Will He find us watching there?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How do we answer these questions?

    "text": "(series 5) <br>3 John 1<br>KJV<br>3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou <b>walkest in the truth</b>.<br>4+ I have no greater joy than to hear that my children <b>walk in truth.</b><br><br>Life’s lessons are taught by following a systematically arranged curriculum or through experience. There is “ systematic truth “ and “ experiential Truth”. <br><br>The pursuit of both is recommended and desirable, but the experiential is the most preferred. An effective, useful, and successful person possesses the combination of both classroom and street ( experiential) sense! <br><br>As the psalmist requested, truth must be taught ; <br>Psalms 86<br>KJV<br>11+ Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.<br><br>In the case of Christianity, an effective useful child of God is the one who not only knows the scriptures ( theoretical) but can apply them in the real world   It is not about “ quotation “ it is about “ application”. <br><br>Two things are highlighted in the above scripture passages, “to walk in the truth” and “to walk in truth”. The two statements are not the same. <br><br>The first presupposes that there is a body of knowledge called “ the truth “  which one must uphold and apply to be described as “ walking in the truth”<br><br>To live and do things as stated in the scriptures is to “ walk in <b>the</b> truth as scripture is the Truth <br>John 17<br>KJV<br>17+ Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<br><br>The question we  must ask ourselves daily is “Are we walking in <b>the truth</b>?”  Are we living lives that are consistent and in conformity with <b>the Truth</b>?” The Word.   <br><br>The second thought conveyed in the verses above is “ walking <b>in truth</b>” To walk In Truth is simply to be sincere, honest, to be a promise keeper, reliable, trustworthy, your word is your bond. One word sums it up “ principled”. <br><br>To walk in the teeth gladdens the heart of God and fellow man. The Apostle John could not hide his joy when he saw and experienced the life of the children of a Christian sister. <br><br>2 John 1<br>KJV<br>4+ I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.<br><br>When the knowledge of the Word of God influences us it makes us walk in truth. We deal sincerely and honestly with people as we live principled lives. <br><br>Interestingly, it is only fellow principled people who see this and admire the principled. The unprincipled finds it difficult to understand let alone accept them! <br><br>Yes, darkness and light can not coexist. The vulgar, rude, uncouth etc can not coexist with the disciplined, decent-minded, orderly etc. We see these every day as we relate to people. <br><br>Ever wondered why some disliked, speak evil of you, why your presence in their midst disturbs them etc? It is because you Walk In Truth. You call a spade a spade and not a shovel  You are principled! <br><br>Read God’s promise to the principled, those who walk in truth ; <br>1 Kings 2<br>KJV<br>4+ That the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, <b>If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth</b> with all their <b>heart</b> and with all their <b>soul</b>, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.<br><br>Beloved, teach yourself how to walk not only in <b>the</b> truth but also <b>in</b> truth!<br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe",

It was a night to remember! <br><br>The program was arranged such that Wilson Pickett was to appear on stage exactly at midnight; which he did wearing a black slack with silver buttons that flashed dazzlingly. Guess what, he came on stage as the hour struck midnight with his evergreen song “ Midnight Hour!“ <br><br>The crowd yelled and surged forward  as he spoke the first words of the song “ Am gonna wait till the midnight hour”. And he did! It was a scene best seen/experienced rather than told/described. That was Ghana then! <br><br>Beloved, the mistakes many have made ( and are still making) in life can be attributed to the exercise of poor judgment. Like Lot, many have allowed the “ green grass “to fool them. As the scriptures said,<br> “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where,”. Lot was undiscerning! He did what is described today as “ failure to read between the lines”. <br><br>Oh, how many an undiscerning youth have lifted their eyes and beheld all the fake, pretentious lives  of glamour that celebrities portray  on tv and other social media handles ,  and thought they are real. Only to be disappointed with the passage of time. <br><br>Yes, do not let the fake green grass fool you. In use in Ghana today is an imitated synthetic made  “green grass” used mostly to decorate event grounds.  <br><br>For a natural “green grass” to last long and not die/dry easily the soil must be well prepared, which activity takes time. It also requires regular maintenance . Beloved, for a success to last long, it would require  a deliberate, conscious effort and  preparation .  One must be willing to invest, work hard  and wait patiently. <br><br>There are many today who are in life’s scrap yard , gnashing their teeth because they were fooled by the “ green grass” ! <br><br>Scripture is true, read a few ; <br>Proverbs 13<br>KJV<br>11+ Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.<br><br>Proverbs 20<br>KJV<br>21+ An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.<br><br>Proverbs 28<br>KJV<br>20+ A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.<br><br>Proverbs 28<br>KJV<br>22+ He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.<br><br>The grass is not green everywhere, therefore be discerning ! Like , Lot don’t let the green grass fool you. <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Luke 24<br>KJV<br>7+ Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br><br>Unlike political candidates who say many things but are unable to fulfil them, all that Jesus said about himself, and what He will do or be done to Him were all fulfilled. He was an amazing Man of His Words who must be taken seriously. <br><br>One such prediction is what you’ve read;  that He will be betrayed, condemned and crucified and on the third day shall rise again. <br><br>When He first said these many were those who doubted Him, made mockery and ridiculed  Him, but it came to pass. <br><br>In the early hours of the First Day of the week, the city of Jerusalem woke up to “ breaking news ! ”. <br><br>Three women on a fact-finding mission to the cemetery where He was buried met with an empty tomb. They hurried back to town to gossip their findings to a few. They gossiped because they were afraid. <br><br>But as is normal with gossip no sooner had they whispered this to a few than it became news that went viral. <br><br>Reporters and stringers from the Jerusalem Chronicle, Jerusalem FM John 3:16,  Pilate FM, Matthew 27:24 and sister stations within and outside the city met with these women and interviewed them live on air. <br><br>They described vividly what they saw, the rolled stone, the empty tomb, and the man dressed in white who spoke to them. <br><br>They even repeated word for word what the white-clothed man said “Why seek ye the living among the dead? He has risen “<br><br>Yes, this is the Man Jesus. One newspaper headlined the morning’s publication with the words  “ He said it, and He did It!” The curious nature of the headline made the paper sold fast that by noon it has sold over several thousands. <br><br>Yes without a doubt , that Jesus died , was buried and on the third day rose again from the dead is an undeniable historical fact <br><br>We worship a risen Saviour. Upon the first day of the week as we assemble to break bread and drink of the cup let our voices and hearts rejoice   And may we do it from sincere , pure and honest hearts. <br><br>And., remember he who eat and drink in an unworthy manner, ( wicked , evil , unrepentant heart) eats and drinks damnation unto himself. <br><br>Maranatha <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Before then many have lived in anticipation of when this prophecy will come to pass. <br><br>Yes, “ thou will not leave my soul in Hell; neither wilt thou suffer Thine Holy One To see corruption “. <br>The final contest between the forces of Good and Evil, between Jesus and the Devil was that which began from His condemnation through his trial,  the crucifixion on the Cross, his burial and finally ended with His resurrection! <br><br>Yes, by His resurrection He put to shame the nay-sayers, those who out of envy condemned and crucified Him thinking they had finished Him!  <br><br>Yes, the same will be done to us who have pledged our loyalty to Him, our enemies, our doubters and naysayers shall humiliate and make a mockery of us! <br><br>Yes, beloved our enemies will bury us in disgrace, humiliation and dishonour! They will make our names a byword by soiling our image and reputation, but we shall rise to conquer in the end. <br><br>Just like how He rose from the dead even so shall we also rise from the depth of humiliation, disgrace and dishonor that our foes have buried us. We shall rise to fame and glory in the name of Jesus. Impossibilities shall become possible. <br><br>Yes, he who laughs last laughs best! It is the doings of the Lord, disgrace and dishonor can not keep us down;  in the Name of Jesus we shall pull down the “ bars of shame “. <br><br>A hymn writer put it this way “Death can not keep its prey, he tore the bars away, up from the grave he arose with a mighty triumph over his foes, he arose a Victor from the dark domain and for forever with His saints to reign! <br><br>Yes, Low in the grave He lay Jesus, my Savior!

    "text": "Ecclesiastes 3<br>KJV<br>22+ Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?<br><br>Ask again! “for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?” <br><br>It is easy to forget that this journey that we’ve embarked on here on Earth is a one-way journey. We came with only a one-way return ticket. We can not return to our homes once we leave. <br><br>Our visas are one-way visas and are not renewable when they expire though under certain circumstances they can be extended but not renewed. Visa extension is discretionary and is subject to conditions set by the Issuer! <br><br>What is of great worry and concern to all travellers here is the undisclosed nature of the visas, especially their expiry date. No one knows when, where and how his visa will expire. How long we stay is undisclosed! <br><br>Though many have tried to inquire,  investigate, speculate, propound theories etc; none has come out with any credible way of knowing when his/her visa will expire. <br><br>A hymn writer once said “Though men may search they can not find, for God alone does understand” Indeed the Issuer had stamped on the front page of our passport the following; <br><br>Deuteronomy 29:29 <br>NIV<br>[29] The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.<br><br>This was intended to warn us to desist from undertaking such inquiries and investigations! <br><br>This being the case how should we then spend our days/year’s etc.? <br><br>For the answers, we are privileged to have the memoirs of one person who knew this “one-way ticket “ phenomenon and spent his stay in a certain way so we shall consult him to know how we ought to spend ours! <br><br>There is a warning however, it is not everything he said he did that is recommended so read with care, caution and discernment! Readers are warned! <br><br>Before his visa expired he gave a brief expose of how he saw his stay, a frustrating and disappointing picture. Read it;<br><br>Ecclesiastes 2:18-24 <br>NIV<br>[18] I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. <br><br>[19] And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. <br><br>[20] So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. [21] For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.<br><br> [22] What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? [23] All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.<br><br>Hope was not lost to him, read what he did and hence his advice;  <br><br>[24] <b>A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God</b><br><br>To conclude take note of the following; we came with a one-way return ticket. We shall not come back again. Our visas are non-renewable, even if extended they shall surely expire. As to when we are unaware. We wish we could know how many years remain on our visas!  <br><br>Knowing this take his advice ; <br>Ecclesiastes 2:24 <br>NIV<br>[24] A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,<br><br>( Please do not “misread” or misinterpret  the word “drink” to mean go and “ chill” you are a Ghanaian I know you 🤣)<br><br>But on a more serious note be guided by his final advice <br><br>Ecclesiastes 11<br>KJV<br>9+ Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment<br><br>Ecclesiastes 12<br>KJV<br>13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<br><br>14+ For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.<br><br>A holiday reading I share with you! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Ephesians 4<br>KJV<br>25+ Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.<br><br>Zechariah 8<br>KJV<br>16+ These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates:<br><br>One negative practice that appears to be gaining ground among professing believers is the art of lying. Yes, you read it. <br>Like you, I’ve also asked were we born liars or we learnt them? <br><br>The ease at which lies are told with a straight face makes one wonder if lying is part of our nature. Some say it is part of our “fallen nature” which is true! <br><br>But, surely we were not born liars we learnt them, it is a habit we acquire through association. If you grew up in a lying environment the chances of you becoming one is very high! . <br><br>If you work or associate yourself with liars the chances of you becoming one is very high. It is also evidentially clear that certain professions thrive on lies to succeed so if you should work in such environments/professions the chances of you becoming a liar are high. <br><br>Please note, that I am not implying one is automatically a liar, but the chances of becoming one are high! A conscious deliberate self-restraint is what one needs to stay true to oneself in such environments /professions <br><br>It is therefore a “disease” that we contract through association, so let us therefore watch our associations and walk away from any that have the potential of influencing us to become liars<br><br>“Researchers”  have found that Lie has sisters, these are “ sister rumour-monger”, “sister gossiper” “sister, hatred” and a younger “sister jealousy”  Some have given their mother’s name as “Madam Envy”! <br><br>They described her as a ferocious woman who does not take kindly to truth, hard work and progress anywhere by anyone,  she is feared worldwide. Read it;<br><br>Proverbs 27<br>KJV<br>4+ Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?<br><br>Who is able to stand before Mrs ( Mr) Envy? <br><br>Beloved, of great worry and concern, is how some have perfected this act of lying such that they are believed by even the wise! They know what to put together, how to present and say things, etc. <br><br>But why must someone lie? The reasons are many but the most important ones are,  fear, insecurity, low self-esteem, inadequacy, and the  craving for social acceptance and glorification   (You can add yours)<br><br>Beloved,  lies do not build, it rather destroy. It has been known to be the cause of breakdowns, and divisions among hitherto peaceful and loving relationships! <br><br>Dearly beloved if we can go by what the scriptures teach, we should not experience any such unpleasant situations; which is <br><br>Ephesians 4<br>KJV<br>25+ Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.<br><br>To lie is to betray a trust, and trust is the foundation on which relationships are built once betrayed everything crumbles! Many a once-strong relationship has crumbled as a result Of this act. <br><br>To put back the pieces ( trust ) is a Herculean task even if done it never looks the same as the original. So let us be careful about things we say to and about one another. <br><br>May we heed Paul’s admonition <br>Colossians 4<br>KJV<br>6+ Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.<br><br>May peace and truth be with and among us forever. Let us work towards achieving this! I desire to live in peace with you based on shared love and the truth we speak to each other. <br><br>My thoughts to share <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Matthew 5<br>KJV<br>20+ For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>In a recent conversation with a friend, this issue of how are we going to be assessed came up! I tried to avoid, evade, and abort it but to no avail !! I kept saying “Can we change the topic, conversation etc but he kept asking! So we sat down to discuss it in an informal manner <br><br>My attempt to avoid it is simple I don’t know. Though I said this several times it was such that I had to yield. So what you are about to read are views we both expressed and shared. <br><br>We began by asking is it possible that there would be a pass mark. A range! A cut-off point, etc? We both concluded that yes it is likely. We based our conclusion on the above passage. <br><br>It is a comparative passage “Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,”   The word “ except “ is the operative word suggesting that there is a baseline which must be crossed. <br><br>The “righteousness “ of the Scribes and Pharisees  was set as the baseline which must be crossed before one can “enter into the kingdom of heaven.” <br><br>Indeed the entire context in which this verse was placed indicates that the bar is higher for Christians.<br><br> I told some young men that the examination I wrote and passed to qualify me for a scholarship to study in the UK if it were today I’d have failed to qualify! Each generation or dispensation has its own threshold and standard of assessing who qualifies and who does not. <br><br>If this is so, then it follows that yes there is a criterion, a pass mark that one must attain to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. <br><br>So strive to attain this pass mark. The how is what follows in the second instalment. <br><br>What is important is to note that living recklessly, haphazardly, carelessly thinking o God is merciful, forgiving etc and will surely grant one a place regardless is to deceive oneself. <br><br>To excel in school we all know what it takes;  ask to be told in case you don’t! Ask Azumah Nelson what it took him to become an undefeated champion<br><br>Even the great apostle Paul said this about himself and his quest to make the grade.  Read it ; <br>1 Corinthians 9<br>KJV<br>27+ But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.<br><br>My dear, there is a pass mark to be attained. Strive to make it. Before we parted company we both agreed on how difficult it would be. But we also agreed that God has given us a bonus mark; the righteousness of Christ! This has been credited to us. All that is left for us is to  “top it up”. <br><br>God through Christ gave us 70% look for 30% to top up! <br><br>Matthew 5:20 <br>NIV<br>[20] For I tell you that <b>unless your righteousness qsurpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven</b>.<br><br>Please this is not a doctrinal teaching or belief, it is a friendly hypothesis just to warn us of the need to be prepared! Surely we must cross a pass mark. <br>Philippians 2:12 NIV<br>[12] Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed---not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence---continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,<br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Why would the resurrection from the dead of this Man bring to a stop all activities of life? This is an incomprehensible global phenomenon! <br><br>Since the beginning of time no man’s death, not presidents, monarchs etc has ever been marked worldwide than this Man. <br><br>Why is this man’s death observed, it is because it was by this event that Humanity gained its freedom from Death. <b>The resurrection of Jesus from the dead gave hope to a hitherto hopeless world that has until then been living in the fear of death</b>. <br><br>Read how the Hebrew writer described man’s hopeless state before the resurrection; <br><br>Hebrews 2:14-15 <br>NIV<br>[14] Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death---that is, the devil--- <br><br>[15] <b>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death</b><br>.<br>By His resurrection, He *destroyed both the Power and Fear of  Death! <b>He brought to life immortality</b>. A truth He stated while alive and confirmed by his coming out of the Grave. Read it;<br><br>John 11:25-26<br> NIV<br>[25] Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; [26] and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”<br><br>Beloved, if there is no resurrection free from the dead then we’ve been deceived and doomed forever. Because it is the resurrection that gives us hope that there is life beyond the Grave. <br><br>It is the resurrection of Jesus that gave us hope that we shall be given an incorruptible body with which we shall live forever. As we can all attest to  “ change and decay in all around we see”for we can not inherit the Kingdom of God while clothed in this corruptible body. <br><br>Read all that there is about this phenomenon; <br><br>1 Corinthians 15:42-44,50-55 <br>NIV<br>[42] So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; [43] it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;<br><br> [44] it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. <br><br>[50] I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. <br><br>[51] Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--- [52] in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. <br><br>[53] For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. <br><br>[54] When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”<br><br> [55] “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”<br>.<br>Yes, the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the Grave is a breakthrough for us who have placed our faith and hope in Him. <br>That we shall live forever is confirmed by this event that took place several centuries ago <br><br><b>Beloved, live your life in a manner as to benefit from this event at the end of your life's journey. Do not wait till it becomes late. Act now</b>! <br><br>Maranatha! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Read this ; <br><br>Matthew 12:13,15 <br>NIV<br>[13] Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other<br><br>[14] But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.<br><br>. [15] Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. <br><br>Even alliances of people who once were enemies, who do not see eye to eye  were formed to harm him; read it <br><br>Mark 3<br>KJV<br>6+ And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.<br><br>In real life, this happens! People who disagree among themselves will unite to fight you because you are their common enemy. Hmm, life! <br><br>I’ve heard a few try to explain the reason for Jesus’ restraint; but “me too” having considered and thought through the events/incidents have come to agree with some who think otherwise. <br><br>These say  “It is not everyone who should know or hear of your success”. Your failures they can be told! . <br><br>Others also say “do not show your wounds to everyone, not everybody has a plaster. Some will put in salt to increase your pain! “<br><br>Beloved on a personal note as I travel through life I’ve found these sayings or admonishments to be true. Perhaps you’ve experienced it yourself except that you did not take note nor care about it! <br><br>It was through experience that many understood why Jesus restrained these men not to tell everybody but was specific in one case regarding those they should tell! Read it ;<br><br>Matthew 8<br>KJV<br>4+ And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, <b>shew thyself to the priest</b>, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br><br>His success story brought him enemies It got to a point that He could not walk in the open, the same has happened to some in real life; they kept themselves away from the company of others. Read it ;<br>John 7<br>KJV<br>1+ After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.<br><br>I’ve heard some give this same restraining order to some people they helped. They told them not to tell anyone. But good deeds can not be hidden they’ll come out just as those Jesus restrained did!! <br><br>Well, all said and done the advice is out there and it is a choice. Not everyone should hear of your success. Not everyone should see your wounds! Be wise! Not everyone who smiles with you loves you. <br><br>My thoughts after thinking through why Jesus restrained some from telling people of His deeds! These are my personal opinions! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Proverbs 3<br>KJV<br>3+ Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:<br>4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br><br>The life that pleases both God and Man according to the proverbs writer rests on two pillars, mercy and truth. To show or have mercy and to speak the truth at all times. <br><br>Is it not true that people who show mercy and speak the truth are loved, admired and appreciated by the majority except a few? <br><br>To understand what mercy means in practical terms read these ; <br>Matthew 25<br>KJV<br>35+ For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<br>36+ Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.<br><br>(also read the  Parable of the Good Samaritan; that Of the Unjust Steward etc and many others ) <br><br><br>What about Truth? We are to speak truth to all just as we are to show mercy to all. Here is where the difficulty lies. Whereas those who show mercy are loved those who speak truth are hated. <br><br>Is this not a contradiction? The very person you love because he showed you mercy, the same person you hated because he told you the truth. <br><br>But what is truth? (You remembered Pilate!)<br><br>Let’s begin with what truth is not, truth is not an allegation, it is not an assumption, I think, not perception, not a conjecture! Truth is a fact, even if it is hearsay you have investigated it and can confirm it with (empirical) evidence! <br><br>Read how the Apostle John defined truth regarding the humanity of Christ when it came under dispute by the Docetists. John’s writing (1john) was a response to the philosophy called “ Docetism” derived from the Greek word “ dokea “ which translates “ to seem, look like”. <br>( More about this another time)<br><br>John introduced his letter by stating who Jesus was, <br><br>1 John 1:1-4 <br>NIV<br>[1] <b>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched</b>---this we proclaim concerning the Word of life<br><br>. [2] The life appeared; <b>we have seen it and testify to it</b>, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and <b>has appeared to us</b>. <br><br>[3] <b>We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard</b>, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. [4] We write this to make our joy complete.<br><br>So now you know what qualifies to be called truth. Facts. To speak truth is to say for sure and with certainty what one knows (substantiate with evidence when demanded or requested)  <br><br> When Nathan confronted David concerning Bathsheba, he did not state a hearsay or an allegation but undeniable facts. <br><br>This is what the proverb writer is advising us to observe, <br>Proverbs 3:1-2<br> NIV<br>[1] My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, [2] for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity.<br><br>*Mercy and Truth” should not depart from you. Show mercy , yes but also be truthful! <br><br>These are hard, difficult and expensive but they are doable if one commits himself to doing them. There is always a price to pay for everything but the rewards surpass and are worth it. <br><br>A thought to share <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

In this follow up l intend to demonstrate the example God showed us so we emulate Him. <br><br>Before Jesus came everything men knew about God was theoretical, hypothetical, etc.  When they hear “ God is love “ it does not make sense it sounds ok in the ears but it can not and is not comprehended in real terms. <br><br>Everything taught to the Jews was theoretical; you’ll remember at the funeral of Lazarus Jesus engaged his sisters in a conversation.<br><br>Well let’s replay parts of that conversation to help you understand what I mean by before Jesus came everything about God was theoretical concepts <br><br>John 11:21-26 <br>NIV<br>[21] “Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. [22] But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”<br><br> [23] Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” [24] Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”<br><br> [25] Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; [26] and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”<br><br>Here the subject matter was the “ resurrection “ and from what Martha said she has heard, and been taught all about this subject but she was made to understand that it was “ futuristic”. <br><br>No one can fault her she was right for that was what it was! Many things they were taught at their “rabbinical school” ( makaranta! Is the Muslim version) were theoretical <br><br>Now hear what Jesus said to her <br>John 11:25<br> NIV<br>[25] Jesus said to her, “<b>I am the resurrection</b> and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;<br><br>Jesus said “My dear in times past the resurrection was a concept, but standing right before you is the real thing -I AM THE RESURRECTION” In other words “ the word ( theory, concept) has become real! <br><br>This is what John meant when he said <br>John 1:14<br> NIV<br>[14] <b>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us</b>. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.<br><br>God who in the past was a concept, imaginary thought etc took upon himself flesh so He can be seen and known, no more a theory. Fili fili! <br><br>This is what John said, they experienced Him, walked and ate with Him. He was real <br><br>1 John 1:1 NIV<br>[1] That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched---this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.<br><br>To John, their preaching was not theoretical but experiential. This truly is what effective, powerful preaching/teaching is about. Experiential not theoretical! <br><br>By the coming of Jesus, the Word became flesh. God who was hitherto mere words became a reality everything said and taught about Him was made manifest and demonstrated;  made real. <br><br>In Christ, God backed His love for us in real terms! Beloved, God’s love for you is not a concept or theory ( mere words ) but real. <br><br>May we learn to practicalize our words through deeds so men will know what we mean when we say something! God showed us how to do it. <br><br>My thoughts to share <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "James 2<br>KJV<br>15+ If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br><br>16+ And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<br><br>The greatest challenge we face as Believers is our inability to translate words into deeds. If you’ve lived as long as some have you’ll understand what this means. <br><br>James saw firsthand how members of the congregation he attended were responding to an appeal made on behalf of a destitute hence his inspired rhetorical question. He wrote from practical experience and observation. <br><br>In effect, he is saying words are meaningless if not backed by deeds. We see this daily in our fellowship where some stand in the midst of the assembly and pours out their needs! In our case, beloved what do we do? We are simply asked to stand and “ commit the sister/brother to the Lord’s care”. <br><br>A long twenty to thirty-minute prayer is said citing and quoting copious verses of scriptures to remind God (as if He has forgotten)  that he must meet the needs of the one with the request. <br><br>We even issue as it were a “ veiled threat “ in our prayers by asking  Him to act to avoid disgrace before unbelievers. Who will ask “Where is our God?” <br><br>After the prayer as usual we walk to the needy to shake his/her hands and console and comfort him/her with more words; not a hint or personal assurance of help from us. <br><br>This is what James was alluding to; read it <br>James 2:16 <br>NIV<br>[16] <b>If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed</b>,” <br><br>Nyamè wô hô ôbè yè! Fama Nyame! Ôtsèsô Nyamè wô tsè à aboà entetià sô nyà bî ( forgive my poor twi!) <br><br>There have been instances where some have refused to tell their congregation the sufferings they are going through   When asked why, they replied  “ I know them they hear but do nothing! So I am better off not telling them”. O! <br><br>Yes,  beloved this is what happens when words mean nothing but sounds to some, and because they would not want their ears to be disturbed they prefer not to open up! <br><br>There is a need for us individually and collectively to examine ourselves concerning these ! Words without acts mean nothing but mere sounds to a sufferer. This trend of behaviour is very high among us. <br><br>The Apostle John also saw what James experienced; read how he put it; <br><br>1 John 3:18<br> NIV<br>[18] Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.<br><br>I, John (the minister) have also seen and continue to experience this hence what you’ve just read.

I go to prepare a place for you.<br><br>My dear, it is very easy to forget why we are followers of Jesus,  this comes when we get ourselves involved in fighting over irrelevant unrelated things! <br><br>Things like arguing about who is who in the church, who commands and who must obey, who smiles with me and who does not, preferring one over another,  forming and upholding alliances etc. <br><br>These are irrelevant yet they are top on the agenda of some as a result they focus on how to either undo or overdo the other. <br><br>The disciples at a point in time engaged themselves in similar irrelevant arguments in the time of Christ. Read one; <br><br>Mark 9<br>KJV<br>33+ And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way?<br>34+ But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest. <br><br>Luke 22<br>KJV<br>24+ And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.<br><br>Even two of them engaged their mother to lobby on their behalf. Read it; <br><br>Matthew 20<br>KJV<br>20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.<br><br>21+ And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.<br><br>Beloved,  what should engage our thoughts and minds is how to be a recipient of one of the promised mansions! What must I do to inherit one, should be our greatest concern! <br><br>Dear reader, be careful you don’t become a “ homeless “ person in heaven by pursuing the irrelevant to the neglecting of the relevant! <br>In actual fact, there will be none there! Which means you will not be there. Sad. <br><br>Read what Paul said should occupy our thoughts and minds;<br><br>Philippians 4:8 <br>NIV<br>[8] Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable---if anything is excellent or praiseworthy---think about such things.<br><br>A free <b>mansion</b>  in Heaven is to be preferred to what pertains here so think these thoughts, and concern yourself with what will get you one! <br><br>While here, beloved let us do whatever will put our names on the “waiting- list!”<br><br>My thoughts as I relook at the words of Jesus. Is your name on the waiting -list? <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

For example the designation, Christian is applied to anyone who attends a Church. But is this what it should be? <br><br>In interviews when one is asked what religion he professes the answer is Christianity   Meanwhile he does not live by what his faith teaches. His is an outward profession <br><br>This is what Paul was concerned about in the case of the Jew. He prides himself on being a Jew but in reality, his “ Jewishness “ is not seen through his deeds. It is only a tag or badge that he wears. <br><br>Beloved, Can’t this be said of many who profess to be Christians? Isn’t our profession just a tag or a badge we wear outwardly? <br><br>From what Paul is saying, One is not a Christian outwardly but rather inwardly. Christianity is not a badge to be worn but a life to lead. True Christianity is the outward expression of what is in the heart! <br><br>In other words, one is not a Christian by words but by deeds. Now, the question is do our deeds confirm what we profess to be? <br><br>Read what Paul said is the real   definition of a Jew; <br>Romans 2:29 <br>NIV<br>[29] No, <b>a person is a Jew who is one inwardly</b>; and circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a person's praise is not from other people, but from God.<br><br>Apply this to our modern time, a Christian is one inward,  on whose heart is written the laws/rules of Christ.

    "text": "2 Corinthians 7<br>KJV<br>1+ Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br><br>This appeal by Paul continues to be valid and of great relevance today. He made mention of two types of “ filth “ the filthiness of the flesh “ and that of the “ spirit “ ! <br><br>Indeed as our cities and surroundings are engulfed by material ( physical )  filth even so are some fellowships engulfed with spiritual filth. <br><br>What is worrying is just like how we can live the filth in our community without raising a voice; even so, we can live with the spiritual filth that surrounds us in the fellowship without raising a voice. <br><br>Like society, dare to raise a voice and you’ll be shot down even so it is in some fellowships.  <br><br>But what is  “filthiness of the flesh ?” Simply put anything that contaminates and works against the natural purpose and use of the flesh. This definition is broad so you can fill in the specifics. <br><br>Any moral conduct, behavior etc that contradicts the normal, acceptable standard is a filthiness Of the flesh. <br><br>Paul gives a clue, read it <br>Romans 1<br>KJV<br>26+ For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<br><br>27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<br><br>Any abuse ( two words put together; abnormal and use =abuse, abnormal usage ) of nature results in “filthiness of the flesh” such as “gratifications” <br><br>Paul is saying, dear believer now that you have switched sides by your conversion do away with any form of abuse that will make you fleshly filthy. <br><br>Filthiness of the flesh therefore has to do with moral and ethical failure. <br><br>Do not forget, He has said ;<br>2 Corinthians 5<br>KJV<br>17+ Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new.<br><br>What about “ filthiness of spirit?” This has to do with spiritual contamination, some things contaminate the spirit, negative things that take place inside us. <br><br>Our evil thoughts and minds about someone or something etc. A contaminated spirit can not pray to God and expect to be heard. A contaminated spirit (heart)  can not offer an acceptable sacrifice ( worship ) to God<br><br>Read what Jesus said about the filthiness of the spirit and what it can not do.  <br><br> Matthew 6<br>KJV<br>14+ For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<br><br>15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<br><br>Ever wondered why your prayers are not answered? Well, among other reasons it is the spiritual filth ( hatred, envy, jealousy, evil speaking etc) that is in your heart against someone which is the reason. Your spirit is contaminated, it is filthy <br><br>Another example of spiritual filth; <br>Matthew 5<br>KJV<br>23+ Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;<br><br>24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<br><br>With a spiritually filthy heart, how can one’s sacrifice be accepted? <br><br>Finally, spiritual filth includes dabbling in spiritism and consulting with spiritualists, to invoke curses on perceived enemies. <br><br>Beloved, this is what Paul meant by his appeal ; <br><br>2 Corinthians 7:1 <br>NIV<br>[1] Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God<br><br>Let us rid ourselves of any filth be it fleshly or spiritual. <br><br>Thoughts to share. <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe.<br>",

I can't imagine Moses being a song’s teacher!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God knew long ago what we now know concerning the impact and power of songs!

As you ponder over the words you now understand them better than before, because you can relate to them through experience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every hymn/song is experiential, the author or composer wrote from experience.

    "text": "<p>Give No Ear: A Practical Advice</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7<br>KJV<br>20 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.<br>21+ Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The writer of these words, Solomon to me was a pragmatist and it is this that draws me closer to him! He tells it as it is and calls a spade a spade.</p><p>How I wish I could leave behind my diaries to be read by all just like he has done with his titled Ecclesiastics! I’ve been working on mine for many years now! Hmmm! Enyè easy!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the two verses above he confirms what is true but often inadmissible by many. There is no perfect man on earth, we are all “ striving” and “learning” to be! Each one is at one stage higher or lower than the other! This is a fact of life!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7:20&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[20] Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve heard it said, “Whatever you do people will talk about you !” Have you asked why? This happens because those who are at your level of maturity understand and appreciate you whereas those below will condemn and speak evil of you! It is as simple as this</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is so because their level of understanding, knowledge and experience is lower than yours. If they wear the shoes you wore, stand where you stood, hear what you heard, and see what you saw and know what you knew ; they’ll appreciate and make informed comments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But quite often this is not the case &nbsp;It is for this reason that Solomon advised;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7:21&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[21] *Do not pay attention to every word people say*, or you may hear your servant cursing you---</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is not “every word, “ they say which is relevant some may others may not. Take the relevant and throw the irrelevant into the trash basket! In other words, do not take them to heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This calls for discernment, the ability to discern what is and what is not, and here lies the difficulty!&nbsp;<br><br>To the immature and unwise everything said ( words) is relevant. So he ends up hearing his servant cursing him which makes him go mad!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If only we could apply the “Solomonic” formula and advice to tell the relevant from the irrelevant it would help us know who to listen to or not. It is not everything said by everybody that matters.&nbsp;<br>Some things said by some matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to know where this approach is more pronounced and applicable then it is the political arena. Whatever a ruling government says or does the opposition will say the contrary. Some of the “ contrary “ statements, suggestions etc will make sense others non-sense!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved do not give ear to everything said about you, you know yourself better than they do. Listen to some, ignore others. Move on with your life, always remember people’s level of maturity informs what they see and what they say!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You owe no one an explanation except God! He will judge you according to what He knows about you He will not call any to tell Him anything about you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 Corinthians 5<br>KJV<br>10+ For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 14<br>KJV<br>10+ But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe</p>",

Of interest to me are the dates written on them.

Amazing sight to see.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stood still and asked what the conditions of the bodies buried under the concrete slabs were. It is likely their flesh is turned to earth and so also may their bones be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While I walked away the truth that hit me hard in the face is what God said “” For dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”&nbsp;We came from the earth and shall return to it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, everything came from the earth and shall return to the same !

I have encountered frustrations and disappointments in life ( and still do!); but the ‘whispers’ of a few placed my feet firmly on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My story, like yours, is not different from that of Peter, Can you imagine the frustrations and disappointments with which he uttered these words?&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Luke 5:5</p><p>NIV</p><p>[5] Simon answered, “Master, we've worked hard all night and haven't caught anything.

These will say “ We ( experts ) have toiled all night catching nothing; who are you and what do you know about fishing?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, we hear this said to many today. “Who are you to say this or that ??”I like the word Peter used” <strong>Nevertheless</strong>” Yes, nevertheless, regardless of who or what “ I will give it a try”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Come to think of it, Jesus did not say anything Peter didn’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><blockquote><p>4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context seems to suggest that Peter and his crew had earlier gone on a fishing expedition which resulted in nothing. So they berthed their boats and washed their nets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><blockquote><p>Luke 5:2-3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[2] He saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[3] He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore.

The Valley Of Decision!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In every man’s life, there comes a moment that demands action—a decisive moment that, if left unattended, can lead to a lifelong disaster!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the Valley of Decision, we are confronted with questions that have to do with our destiny. Questions that have to do with our spiritual, economic, social etc destinies.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decisions and choices we make will shape our life’s destinies. What we are today reflects the choices we made in the past.. What we shall be tomorrow is based on what we do or don’t do today</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some choices are irreversible and so are some decisions. Ask any aged person and he /she will confirm this to you. This is because he/she has once walked through the Valley of Decision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every step we take in every hour or day forms part of the building blocks we lay for our future. The entire structure of the building will be completed at our old age. It is for this reason that we must weigh carefully the choices we make.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It must be admitted, many of us (including this writer ) have made some irreversible choices, the consequences of which are with us today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Human as we are we can not escape such mistakes. We just have to accept and live with them till we sleep one night and wake up no more! . Though a difficult and daunting task yet we have no choice but to face it squarely&nbsp; &nbsp;To procrastinate is to postpone what will catch up with us later&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walking through the Valley of Decision in life, beloved requires help. Hear how someone who once walked through this Valley concluded;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalms 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rod and staff here indicate, training, guidance and discipline.

He does these through the Word and promptings! A key feature in the believer’s daily walk with God which unfortunately the majority overlook! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Valley of Decision is a valley that some have visited and climbed out of, Make every effort to walk through it successfully!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>If you ever find yourself in the Valley of Decision do not panic seek help when and where necessary. &nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Self Restraint: An Essential Requirement&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 25</p><p>KJV</p><p>28+ He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I&nbsp; am not a chef, nor do I have any cooking experience, but anytime I taste a delicious meal I often ask to know the “what” and “how”. The answer I usually get always points to the “ingredients “ used.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am told by the “experts” that for a meal to pass the test, it must have the right proportions of ingredients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I found this knowledge relevant and applicable to life. For any life to be called a good life it must have in proportion all virtues. Virtues such as honesty , trustworthiness , politeness , respectfulness etc. Most important of all is “self-restraint”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the above scriptures state, “self-restraint” “ self rule “and “self-control” must be part of what it takes to be a good-natured man.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To hold one’s spirit in check no matter what the situation may be, is more to be preferred than anything else.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>32+ He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It does not take much to take a city but it takes much to rule one’s spirit. To take a city is an external warfare but to rule one’s spirit is internal which is the toughest. This explains why not many can rule their spirits!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be unable to rule one’s spirit is simply to be lacking in character, unprincipled, because <strong>character is the anchor that holds a person in check amid human storms!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may have been at some meetings where there were outbursts, tempers flaring and the atmosphere was thick and tense. This is because someone failed to ‘rule his spirit’!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be around people who have mastered the art of self-restraint is a joy and a delight, Conversations and discussions are conducted in a low tone! &nbsp;Anything said no matter how unpleasant does not provoke outbursts, silence is maintained! Each at the meeting has learned to swallow his pride!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take note, when two people standing close to each other speak (shout) to each other in a high tone then know that they are out of sync. They’ve both failed to rule their spirits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, how do we self-restrain (rule) our spirits? It begins with self-respect which is then extended to others.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next is acceptance; to accept that all men are not the same in terms of thought and practice; there will always be differences. Make room for divergent views and opinions, speak/express yours respectfully and politely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not everyone knows what you know, In life some are above you, while others are below in many respects. So factor this into your dealings with people. Learn from the one above you, and teach the one below you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learn to agree, and or disagree, know what is essential and what is not.&nbsp; In essentials stand firm on nonessential give way to liberty!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walk away from anyone who is lacking in character and is unprincipled! Avoid the “noisy”, these are vexations to the spirit&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always remember, in the midst of the unwise, it would be foolhardy to be wise. As a proverb says so “ save your breath to cool your porridge “.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always remember this;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 9:8-9&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[8] Do not rebuke mockers or they will hate you; rebuke the wise and they will love you. [9] Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Above all, exercise maximum self-control by putting a heavy padlock on your lips among provocateurs. Be deliberate and conscious.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, be patient towards all;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>8</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</p><p><strong>9</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
