    "text": "<p>A Cautionary Advice To A Young Friend</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>17+ The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many of us the aged have for friends some young men and women. Occasionally we meet and interact, and we tell one another “What was and &nbsp;what is!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Generations differ no one doubts this, however, some principles don’t change with generational change.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rate at which societal values are changing has been a source of worry and concern to the older generation! In a conversation with a young friend, this issue came up.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The conclusion we both came up with was “ somebody ( a generation) went to sleep” A generation failed to uphold and pass on to the other what it received. It is this failure that has brought us to where we are today! The question was How do we then reset the clock?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see and experience these in every sphere of life be it social, church, family or national. Had the failed generation followed the principle of transferring to others what it received we would have maintain high moral and ethical standards and sanity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the Church we have kept and observe the Lord’s Supper because, as Paul said ;&nbsp;</p><p>Corinthians 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have passed on to us values that have kept past generations sound, united, responsive and respectful. Today all these have crumbled before our very eyes. This is a laissez-faire generation!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The sages of old have always held as sacrosanct this commandment;</p><p>Proverbs 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>8+ My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</p><p>2+ Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do we see today?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, the “old order changeth”, but eternal laws/principles, truths etc remain the same. These are what is called the “ eternal non-negotiable principles and laws”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of which is respect for the elderly, in whom reside refined quality thought, wisdom and common sense as a result of experience gathered through life!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If only we could all pay attention to this warning, our journey would be smooth and end well! &nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 20</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every generation was once a youthful generation, blessed are those who recognize that progress and success lie in the degree and extent to which they treat those who were before them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything is an inheritance, a transference from one generation to the other. What have you inherited? And from whom? Your deeds etc will reveal what you inherited and from whom!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eyes are watching l!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The contents of a wicked heart are seen through deeds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a heart that conceives, plans and executes evil as if it were for fun! A wicked heart is a heart that rejoices and stands aloof when others suffer. It is self-centred.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also a heart full of vengeance, that knows no forgiveness unless he has paid back evil with evil. It is a vindictive heart! It is a hypocritical, pretentious heart that laughs /smiles but will stab at the first opportunity it gets&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read the psalmist’s experience which he captured in these vivid words;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psalm 41:6,9</p><p>NIV</p><p>[6] When one of them comes to see me, he speaks falsely, while his heart gathers slander; then he goes out and spreads it around.

    "text": "<p>Psalms 45<br>KJV<br>1+ My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psalm 45:1&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[1] My heart is stirred by a noble theme as I recite my verses for the king; my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like me, I am sure &nbsp;you don’t know, nor has it ever occurred to you that the “ &nbsp;tongue is a pen!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I found this verse very interesting especially as it described the “tongue” as a pen! &nbsp;“My tongue is the pen of a skillful writer”!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed some speak just as they write; this is a gift. Very skillful in their choices of words either spoken or written. It is always a delight to hear them speak or read what they write</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To speak therefore is the same as to write with a pen, &nbsp;one is audible the other silent, they all have the same audience!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Words spoken or written can be classified into two categories: wise and unwise. They can make or break the spirit of their hearers or readers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore heed this admonition;&nbsp;<br>Proverbs 25<br>KJV<br>11+ A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p><p>Proverbs 15:23&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[23] A person finds joy in giving an apt reply---and how good is a <strong>timely word</strong>!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Timely words </strong>are very important, read how Isaiah puts it ; &nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 50<br>KJV<br>4+ The Lord God hath given me the <strong>tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season</strong> to him that is weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.<br><br>Words whether spoken or written live forever in the minds of both hearers and readers. Their effects may be forgiven or forgotten but not the words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a practical note, I’ve had many referring me to things I’ve said or written before. Some in context others taken out of context!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to note that the words we speak or write will be recalled on the Day of Judgment as testimonies for or against us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 12<br>KJV<br>36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p><p>37+ For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p><p>James also warned ;&nbsp;</p><p><br>James 3:1-2&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[1] Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.</p><p>[2] We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, beloved choose your words, do your best to let them be appropriate and relevant to the occasion. Be measured and economical in the use of words; either spoken or written.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tongue is a pen, use it wisely! In writing we think through before we put any word on paper, in like manner train your tongue to weigh words before they are uttered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The careless use of words has caused many a relationship, either friendship or marriage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe</p>",

    "text": "<p><br>Acts 1<br>KJV<br>11+ Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was said many centuries ago and has remained the main hope and expectation of all believers!&nbsp;<br>Can it truly be said that we await with preparation and expectation, &nbsp;His second coming? &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When was the last time you heard a sermon on The Second Coming? It has been assumed and therefore pushed to the back burner. This explains why the faith of many has grown cold because they’ve lost appetite for heaven. Hmmm</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rereading these scriptures brought to mind the famous statement often heard at the end of every Fu Manchu film series from the lips of popular actor Christopher Lee, aka Fu Manchu!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our youth (1960/70) we watched a series of films depicting a notorious underworld figure called Fu Manchu. Though at the end of every series he would be caught, yet before the film is brought to a close he would appear and utter the words “ the world shall hear of me again”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As naive as we then were, this statement from Fu Manchu frightens us because we see him appear in another episode; we often wonder how he could reappear after his death! Truly, It is great to be young!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reading what the angel told the disciples should remind us that &nbsp;“&nbsp;<br>this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This means Jesus will return in a physical form and not as a spirit as some claim and will be seen by all! What is unknown is the when! The ‘how’ we know, the ‘where He will come from’ &nbsp;we know.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you thought about this? On that day a great mystery shall be solved as we shall see Him as He is! Whether white, black, yellow-skinned etc we don’t know. That day and hour shall declare! Truly we look forward to that day and His appearance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, since we don’t know the “when” let each be always ready so His return does not take him/her unaware. The question that should be of great concern &nbsp;is where will He find us? In what state or condition? Peaceful or angry, loving or hating? Etc. Think about this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This question worried Fanny J Crosby (1820-1915) &nbsp;a blind songwriter which led her to write this hymn ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Jesus comes to reward His servants,<br>Whether it be noon or night,<br>Faithful to Him will He find us watching,<br>With our lamps all trimmed and bright?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Oh, can we say we are ready, brother?<br>Ready for the soul’s bright home?<br>Say, will He find you and me still watching,<br>Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2<br>If at the dawn of the early morning,<br>He shall call us one by one,<br>When to the Lord we restore our talents,<br>Will He answer thee—Well done?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3<br>Have we been true to the trust He left us?<br>Do we seek to do our best?<br>If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,<br>We shall have a glorious rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4<br>Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching,<br>In His glory they shall share;<br>If He shall come at the dawn or midnight,<br>Will He find us watching there?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How do we answer these questions?

    "text": "(series 5) <br>3 John 1<br>KJV<br>3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou <b>walkest in the truth</b>.<br>4+ I have no greater joy than to hear that my children <b>walk in truth.</b><br><br>Life’s lessons are taught by following a systematically arranged curriculum or through experience. There is “ systematic truth “ and “ experiential Truth”. <br><br>The pursuit of both is recommended and desirable, but the experiential is the most preferred. An effective, useful, and successful person possesses the combination of both classroom and street ( experiential) sense! <br><br>As the psalmist requested, truth must be taught ; <br>Psalms 86<br>KJV<br>11+ Teach me thy way, O Lord; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.<br><br>In the case of Christianity, an effective useful child of God is the one who not only knows the scriptures ( theoretical) but can apply them in the real world   It is not about “ quotation “ it is about “ application”. <br><br>Two things are highlighted in the above scripture passages, “to walk in the truth” and “to walk in truth”. The two statements are not the same. <br><br>The first presupposes that there is a body of knowledge called “ the truth “  which one must uphold and apply to be described as “ walking in the truth”<br><br>To live and do things as stated in the scriptures is to “ walk in <b>the</b> truth as scripture is the Truth <br>John 17<br>KJV<br>17+ Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.<br><br>The question we  must ask ourselves daily is “Are we walking in <b>the truth</b>?”  Are we living lives that are consistent and in conformity with <b>the Truth</b>?” The Word.   <br><br>The second thought conveyed in the verses above is “ walking <b>in truth</b>” To walk In Truth is simply to be sincere, honest, to be a promise keeper, reliable, trustworthy, your word is your bond. One word sums it up “ principled”. <br><br>To walk in the teeth gladdens the heart of God and fellow man. The Apostle John could not hide his joy when he saw and experienced the life of the children of a Christian sister. <br><br>2 John 1<br>KJV<br>4+ I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.<br><br>When the knowledge of the Word of God influences us it makes us walk in truth. We deal sincerely and honestly with people as we live principled lives. <br><br>Interestingly, it is only fellow principled people who see this and admire the principled. The unprincipled finds it difficult to understand let alone accept them! <br><br>Yes, darkness and light can not coexist. The vulgar, rude, uncouth etc can not coexist with the disciplined, decent-minded, orderly etc. We see these every day as we relate to people. <br><br>Ever wondered why some disliked, speak evil of you, why your presence in their midst disturbs them etc? It is because you Walk In Truth. You call a spade a spade and not a shovel  You are principled! <br><br>Read God’s promise to the principled, those who walk in truth ; <br>1 Kings 2<br>KJV<br>4+ That the Lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, <b>If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth</b> with all their <b>heart</b> and with all their <b>soul</b>, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.<br><br>Beloved, teach yourself how to walk not only in <b>the</b> truth but also <b>in</b> truth!<br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe",

It was a night to remember! <br><br>The program was arranged such that Wilson Pickett was to appear on stage exactly at midnight; which he did wearing a black slack with silver buttons that flashed dazzlingly. Guess what, he came on stage as the hour struck midnight with his evergreen song “ Midnight Hour!“ <br><br>The crowd yelled and surged forward  as he spoke the first words of the song “ Am gonna wait till the midnight hour”. And he did! It was a scene best seen/experienced rather than told/described. That was Ghana then! <br><br>Beloved, the mistakes many have made ( and are still making) in life can be attributed to the exercise of poor judgment. Like Lot, many have allowed the “ green grass “to fool them. As the scriptures said,<br> “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where,”. Lot was undiscerning! He did what is described today as “ failure to read between the lines”. <br><br>Oh, how many an undiscerning youth have lifted their eyes and beheld all the fake, pretentious lives  of glamour that celebrities portray  on tv and other social media handles ,  and thought they are real. Only to be disappointed with the passage of time. <br><br>Yes, do not let the fake green grass fool you. In use in Ghana today is an imitated synthetic made  “green grass” used mostly to decorate event grounds.  <br><br>For a natural “green grass” to last long and not die/dry easily the soil must be well prepared, which activity takes time. It also requires regular maintenance . Beloved, for a success to last long, it would require  a deliberate, conscious effort and  preparation .  One must be willing to invest, work hard  and wait patiently. <br><br>There are many today who are in life’s scrap yard , gnashing their teeth because they were fooled by the “ green grass” ! <br><br>Scripture is true, read a few ; <br>Proverbs 13<br>KJV<br>11+ Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.<br><br>Proverbs 20<br>KJV<br>21+ An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.<br><br>Proverbs 28<br>KJV<br>20+ A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.<br><br>Proverbs 28<br>KJV<br>22+ He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.<br><br>The grass is not green everywhere, therefore be discerning ! Like , Lot don’t let the green grass fool you. <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Before then many have lived in anticipation of when this prophecy will come to pass. <br><br>Yes, “ thou will not leave my soul in Hell; neither wilt thou suffer Thine Holy One To see corruption “. <br>The final contest between the forces of Good and Evil, between Jesus and the Devil was that which began from His condemnation through his trial,  the crucifixion on the Cross, his burial and finally ended with His resurrection! <br><br>Yes, by His resurrection He put to shame the nay-sayers, those who out of envy condemned and crucified Him thinking they had finished Him!  <br><br>Yes, the same will be done to us who have pledged our loyalty to Him, our enemies, our doubters and naysayers shall humiliate and make a mockery of us! <br><br>Yes, beloved our enemies will bury us in disgrace, humiliation and dishonour! They will make our names a byword by soiling our image and reputation, but we shall rise to conquer in the end. <br><br>Just like how He rose from the dead even so shall we also rise from the depth of humiliation, disgrace and dishonor that our foes have buried us.

    "text": "Ecclesiastes 3<br>KJV<br>22+ Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?<br><br>Ask again! “for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?” <br><br>It is easy to forget that this journey that we’ve embarked on here on Earth is a one-way journey. We came with only a one-way return ticket. We can not return to our homes once we leave. <br><br>Our visas are one-way visas and are not renewable when they expire though under certain circumstances they can be extended but not renewed. Visa extension is discretionary and is subject to conditions set by the Issuer! <br><br>What is of great worry and concern to all travellers here is the undisclosed nature of the visas, especially their expiry date. No one knows when, where and how his visa will expire. How long we stay is undisclosed! <br><br>Though many have tried to inquire,  investigate, speculate, propound theories etc; none has come out with any credible way of knowing when his/her visa will expire. <br><br>A hymn writer once said “Though men may search they can not find, for God alone does understand” Indeed the Issuer had stamped on the front page of our passport the following; <br><br>Deuteronomy 29:29 <br>NIV<br>[29] The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.<br><br>This was intended to warn us to desist from undertaking such inquiries and investigations! <br><br>This being the case how should we then spend our days/year’s etc.? <br><br>For the answers, we are privileged to have the memoirs of one person who knew this “one-way ticket “ phenomenon and spent his stay in a certain way so we shall consult him to know how we ought to spend ours! <br><br>There is a warning however, it is not everything he said he did that is recommended so read with care, caution and discernment! Readers are warned! <br><br>Before his visa expired he gave a brief expose of how he saw his stay, a frustrating and disappointing picture. Read it;<br><br>Ecclesiastes 2:18-24 <br>NIV<br>[18] I hated all the things I had toiled for under the sun because I must leave them to the one who comes after me. <br><br>[19] And who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet they will have control over all the fruit of my toil into which I have poured my effort and skill under the sun. This too is meaningless. <br><br>[20] So my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun. [21] For a person may labor with wisdom, knowledge and skill, and then they must leave all they own to another who has not toiled for it. This too is meaningless and a great misfortune.<br><br> [22] What do people get for all the toil and anxious striving with which they labor under the sun? [23] All their days their work is grief and pain; even at night their minds do not rest. This too is meaningless.<br><br>Hope was not lost to him, read what he did and hence his advice;  <br><br>[24] <b>A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God</b><br><br>To conclude take note of the following; we came with a one-way return ticket. We shall not come back again. Our visas are non-renewable, even if extended they shall surely expire. As to when we are unaware. We wish we could know how many years remain on our visas!  <br><br>Knowing this take his advice ; <br>Ecclesiastes 2:24 <br>NIV<br>[24] A person can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in their own toil. This too, I see, is from the hand of God,<br><br>( Please do not “misread” or misinterpret  the word “drink” to mean go and “ chill” you are a Ghanaian I know you 🤣)<br><br>But on a more serious note be guided by his final advice <br><br>Ecclesiastes 11<br>KJV<br>9+ Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment<br><br>Ecclesiastes 12<br>KJV<br>13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.<br><br>14+ For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.<br><br>A holiday reading I share with you! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Yes, you read it. <br>Like you, I’ve also asked were we born liars or we learnt them? <br><br>The ease at which lies are told with a straight face makes one wonder if lying is part of our nature. Some say it is part of our “fallen nature” which is true! <br><br>But, surely we were not born liars we learnt them, it is a habit we acquire through association. If you grew up in a lying environment the chances of you becoming one is very high! . <br><br>If you work or associate yourself with liars the chances of you becoming one is very high. It is also evidentially clear that certain professions thrive on lies to succeed so if you should work in such environments/professions the chances of you becoming a liar are high. <br><br>Please note, that I am not implying one is automatically a liar, but the chances of becoming one are high! A conscious deliberate self-restraint is what one needs to stay true to oneself in such environments /professions <br><br>It is therefore a “disease” that we contract through association, so let us therefore watch our associations and walk away from any that have the potential of influencing us to become liars<br><br>“Researchers”  have found that Lie has sisters, these are “ sister rumour-monger”, “sister gossiper” “sister, hatred” and a younger “sister jealousy”  Some have given their mother’s name as “Madam Envy”! <br><br>They described her as a ferocious woman who does not take kindly to truth, hard work and progress anywhere by anyone,  she is feared worldwide. Read it;<br><br>Proverbs 27<br>KJV<br>4+ Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?<br><br>Who is able to stand before Mrs ( Mr) Envy? <br><br>Beloved, of great worry and concern, is how some have perfected this act of lying such that they are believed by even the wise! They know what to put together, how to present and say things, etc. <br><br>But why must someone lie? The reasons are many but the most important ones are,  fear, insecurity, low self-esteem, inadequacy, and the  craving for social acceptance and glorification   (You can add yours)<br><br>Beloved,  lies do not build, it rather destroy. It has been known to be the cause of breakdowns, and divisions among hitherto peaceful and loving relationships! <br><br>Dearly beloved if we can go by what the scriptures teach, we should not experience any such unpleasant situations; which is <br><br>Ephesians 4<br>KJV<br>25+ Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.<br><br>To lie is to betray a trust, and trust is the foundation on which relationships are built once betrayed everything crumbles! Many a once-strong relationship has crumbled as a result Of this act. <br><br>To put back the pieces ( trust ) is a Herculean task even if done it never looks the same as the original. So let us be careful about things we say to and about one another. <br><br>May we heed Paul’s admonition <br>Colossians 4<br>KJV<br>6+ Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.<br><br>May peace and truth be with and among us forever.

    "text": "Matthew 5<br>KJV<br>20+ For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>In a recent conversation with a friend, this issue of how are we going to be assessed came up! I tried to avoid, evade, and abort it but to no avail !! I kept saying “Can we change the topic, conversation etc but he kept asking! So we sat down to discuss it in an informal manner <br><br>My attempt to avoid it is simple I don’t know. Though I said this several times it was such that I had to yield. So what you are about to read are views we both expressed and shared. <br><br>We began by asking is it possible that there would be a pass mark. A range! A cut-off point, etc? We both concluded that yes it is likely. We based our conclusion on the above passage. <br><br>It is a comparative passage “Except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees,”   The word “ except “ is the operative word suggesting that there is a baseline which must be crossed. <br><br>The “righteousness “ of the Scribes and Pharisees  was set as the baseline which must be crossed before one can “enter into the kingdom of heaven.” <br><br>Indeed the entire context in which this verse was placed indicates that the bar is higher for Christians.<br><br> I told some young men that the examination I wrote and passed to qualify me for a scholarship to study in the UK if it were today I’d have failed to qualify! Each generation or dispensation has its own threshold and standard of assessing who qualifies and who does not. <br><br>If this is so, then it follows that yes there is a criterion, a pass mark that one must attain to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. <br><br>So strive to attain this pass mark. The how is what follows in the second instalment. <br><br>What is important is to note that living recklessly, haphazardly, carelessly thinking o God is merciful, forgiving etc and will surely grant one a place regardless is to deceive oneself. <br><br>To excel in school we all know what it takes;  ask to be told in case you don’t! Ask Azumah Nelson what it took him to become an undefeated champion<br><br>Even the great apostle Paul said this about himself and his quest to make the grade.  Read it ; <br>1 Corinthians 9<br>KJV<br>27+ But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.<br><br>My dear, there is a pass mark to be attained. Strive to make it. Before we parted company we both agreed on how difficult it would be. But we also agreed that God has given us a bonus mark; the righteousness of Christ! This has been credited to us. All that is left for us is to  “top it up”. <br><br>God through Christ gave us 70% look for 30% to top up! <br><br>Matthew 5:20 <br>NIV<br>[20] For I tell you that <b>unless your righteousness qsurpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven</b>.<br><br>Please this is not a doctrinal teaching or belief, it is a friendly hypothesis just to warn us of the need to be prepared! Surely we must cross a pass mark. <br>Philippians 2:12 NIV<br>[12] Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed---not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence---continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling,<br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

Why would the resurrection from the dead of this Man bring to a stop all activities of life? This is an incomprehensible global phenomenon! <br><br>Since the beginning of time no man’s death, not presidents, monarchs etc has ever been marked worldwide than this Man. <br><br>Why is this man’s death observed, it is because it was by this event that Humanity gained its freedom from Death. <b>The resurrection of Jesus from the dead gave hope to a hitherto hopeless world that has until then been living in the fear of death</b>. <br><br>Read how the Hebrew writer described man’s hopeless state before the resurrection; <br><br>Hebrews 2:14-15 <br>NIV<br>[14] Since the children have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the power of him who holds the power of death---that is, the devil--- <br><br>[15] <b>and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death</b><br>.<br>By His resurrection, He *destroyed both the Power and Fear of  Death! <b>He brought to life immortality</b>. A truth He stated while alive and confirmed by his coming out of the Grave. Read it;<br><br>John 11:25-26<br> NIV<br>[25] Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; [26] and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”<br><br>Beloved, if there is no resurrection free from the dead then we’ve been deceived and doomed forever. Because it is the resurrection that gives us hope that there is life beyond the Grave. <br><br>It is the resurrection of Jesus that gave us hope that we shall be given an incorruptible body with which we shall live forever. As we can all attest to  “ change and decay in all around we see”for we can not inherit the Kingdom of God while clothed in this corruptible body. <br><br>Read all that there is about this phenomenon; <br><br>1 Corinthians 15:42-44,50-55 <br>NIV<br>[42] So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable; [43] it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;<br><br> [44] it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. <br><br>[50] I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. <br><br>[51] Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed--- [52] in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. <br><br>[53] For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality. <br><br>[54] When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”<br><br> [55] “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?”<br>.<br>Yes, the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the Grave is a breakthrough for us who have placed our faith and hope in Him. <br>That we shall live forever is confirmed by this event that took place several centuries ago <br><br><b>Beloved, live your life in a manner as to benefit from this event at the end of your life's journey. Do not wait till it becomes late. Act now</b>! <br><br>Maranatha! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Matthew 9<br>KJV<br>30+ And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.<br><br>31 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.<br><br>I’ve come across a few things that Jesus said which I don’t get! One of which is what you’ve just read. You healed some people and placed a restraining order on them that they should not let anyone know! Aba! <br><br>Who lights a candle and places it under a table? For someone to put a lit candle under a table and not on top must have a serious reason or purpose! Why? <br><br>On another occasion ( the transfiguration on the mountain) he placed a limited embargo on the news going out public! Limited because He set a time frame. Read it <br><br>Matthew 17<br>KJV<br>9+ And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, <b>Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead</b><br><br>Again to another; <br>Matthew 8<br>KJV<br>4+ And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br><br>The incidents recorded above and His cautions beat the mind, the fact is the news of his healing would surely give speed to his message as many will take to him; which was the very reason why he came.  And yet He forbade it. <br><br>Who would not like to advertise his success? Surely Jesus has reasons for stopping these recipients of His blessing. Though He did not state clearly the why, observing His actions does give us a clue. <br><br>The truth is the more his acts of mercy spread the more enemies he made for himself.   Read this ; <br><br>Matthew 12:13,15 <br>NIV<br>[13] Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other<br><br>[14] But the Pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill Jesus.<br><br>. [15] Aware of this, Jesus withdrew from that place. <br><br>Even alliances of people who once were enemies, who do not see eye to eye  were formed to harm him; read it <br><br>Mark 3<br>KJV<br>6+ And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.<br><br>In real life, this happens! People who disagree among themselves will unite to fight you because you are their common enemy. Hmm, life! <br><br>I’ve heard a few try to explain the reason for Jesus’ restraint; but “me too” having considered and thought through the events/incidents have come to agree with some who think otherwise. <br><br>These say  “It is not everyone who should know or hear of your success”. Your failures they can be told! . <br><br>Others also say “do not show your wounds to everyone, not everybody has a plaster. Some will put in salt to increase your pain! “<br><br>Beloved on a personal note as I travel through life I’ve found these sayings or admonishments to be true. Perhaps you’ve experienced it yourself except that you did not take note nor care about it! <br><br>It was through experience that many understood why Jesus restrained these men not to tell everybody but was specific in one case regarding those they should tell! Read it ;<br><br>Matthew 8<br>KJV<br>4+ And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way, <b>shew thyself to the priest</b>, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br><br>His success story brought him enemies It got to a point that He could not walk in the open, the same has happened to some in real life; they kept themselves away from the company of others. Read it ;<br>John 7<br>KJV<br>1+ After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.<br><br>I’ve heard some give this same restraining order to some people they helped. They told them not to tell anyone. But good deeds can not be hidden they’ll come out just as those Jesus restrained did!! <br><br>Well, all said and done the advice is out there and it is a choice. Not everyone should hear of your success. Not everyone should see your wounds! Be wise! Not everyone who smiles with you loves you. <br><br>My thoughts after thinking through why Jesus restrained some from telling people of His deeds! These are my personal opinions! <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "Proverbs 3<br>KJV<br>3+ Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:<br>4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br><br>The life that pleases both God and Man according to the proverbs writer rests on two pillars, mercy and truth. To show or have mercy and to speak the truth at all times. <br><br>Is it not true that people who show mercy and speak the truth are loved, admired and appreciated by the majority except a few? <br><br>To understand what mercy means in practical terms read these ; <br>Matthew 25<br>KJV<br>35+ For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<br>36+ Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.<br><br>(also read the  Parable of the Good Samaritan; that Of the Unjust Steward etc and many others ) <br><br><br>What about Truth? We are to speak truth to all just as we are to show mercy to all. Here is where the difficulty lies. Whereas those who show mercy are loved those who speak truth are hated. <br><br>Is this not a contradiction? The very person you love because he showed you mercy, the same person you hated because he told you the truth. <br><br>But what is truth? (You remembered Pilate!)<br><br>Let’s begin with what truth is not, truth is not an allegation, it is not an assumption, I think, not perception, not a conjecture! Truth is a fact, even if it is hearsay you have investigated it and can confirm it with (empirical) evidence! <br><br>Read how the Apostle John defined truth regarding the humanity of Christ when it came under dispute by the Docetists. John’s writing (1john) was a response to the philosophy called “ Docetism” derived from the Greek word “ dokea “ which translates “ to seem, look like”. <br>( More about this another time)<br><br>John introduced his letter by stating who Jesus was, <br><br>1 John 1:1-4 <br>NIV<br>[1] <b>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched</b>---this we proclaim concerning the Word of life<br><br>. [2] The life appeared; <b>we have seen it and testify to it</b>, and we proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and <b>has appeared to us</b>. <br><br>[3] <b>We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard</b>, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. [4] We write this to make our joy complete.<br><br>So now you know what qualifies to be called truth. Facts. To speak truth is to say for sure and with certainty what one knows (substantiate with evidence when demanded or requested)  <br><br> When Nathan confronted David concerning Bathsheba, he did not state a hearsay or an allegation but undeniable facts. <br><br>This is what the proverb writer is advising us to observe, <br>Proverbs 3:1-2<br> NIV<br>[1] My son, do not forget my teaching, but keep my commands in your heart, [2] for they will prolong your life many years and bring you peace and prosperity.<br><br>*Mercy and Truth” should not depart from you. Show mercy , yes but also be truthful! <br><br>These are hard, difficult and expensive but they are doable if one commits himself to doing them. There is always a price to pay for everything but the rewards surpass and are worth it. <br><br>A thought to share <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "John 1<br>KJV<br>14+ And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.<br><br>In my earlier article, I made the case against inaction and the mere uttering of words! In this follow up l intend to demonstrate the example God showed us so we emulate Him. <br><br>Before Jesus came everything men knew about God was theoretical, hypothetical, etc.  When they hear “ God is love “ it does not make sense it sounds ok in the ears but it can not and is not comprehended in real terms. <br><br>Everything taught to the Jews was theoretical; you’ll remember at the funeral of Lazarus Jesus engaged his sisters in a conversation.<br><br>Well let’s replay parts of that conversation to help you understand what I mean by before Jesus came everything about God was theoretical concepts <br><br>John 11:21-26 <br>NIV<br>[21] “Lord,” Martha said to Jesus, “if you had been here, my brother would not have died. [22] But I know that even now God will give you whatever you ask.”<br><br> [23] Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.” [24] Martha answered, “I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”<br><br> [25] Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; [26] and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”<br><br>Here the subject matter was the “ resurrection “ and from what Martha said she has heard, and been taught all about this subject but she was made to understand that it was “ futuristic”. <br><br>No one can fault her she was right for that was what it was! Many things they were taught at their “rabbinical school” ( makaranta! Is the Muslim version) were theoretical <br><br>Now hear what Jesus said to her <br>John 11:25<br> NIV<br>[25] Jesus said to her, “<b>I am the resurrection</b> and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die;<br><br>Jesus said “My dear in times past the resurrection was a concept, but standing right before you is the real thing -I AM THE RESURRECTION” In other words “ the word ( theory, concept) has become real! <br><br>This is what John meant when he said <br>John 1:14<br> NIV<br>[14] <b>The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us</b>. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.<br><br>God who in the past was a concept, imaginary thought etc took upon himself flesh so He can be seen and known, no more a theory. Fili fili! <br><br>This is what John said, they experienced Him, walked and ate with Him. He was real <br><br>1 John 1:1 NIV<br>[1] That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked at and our hands have touched---this we proclaim concerning the Word of life.<br><br>To John, their preaching was not theoretical but experiential. This truly is what effective, powerful preaching/teaching is about. Experiential not theoretical! <br><br>By the coming of Jesus, the Word became flesh. God who was hitherto mere words became a reality everything said and taught about Him was made manifest and demonstrated;  made real. <br><br>In Christ, God backed His love for us in real terms! Beloved, God’s love for you is not a concept or theory ( mere words ) but real. <br><br>May we learn to practicalize our words through deeds so men will know what we mean when we say something! God showed us how to do it. <br><br>My thoughts to share <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "James 2<br>KJV<br>15+ If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,<br><br>16+ And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?<br><br>The greatest challenge we face as Believers is our inability to translate words into deeds. If you’ve lived as long as some have you’ll understand what this means. <br><br>James saw firsthand how members of the congregation he attended were responding to an appeal made on behalf of a destitute hence his inspired rhetorical question. He wrote from practical experience and observation. <br><br>In effect, he is saying words are meaningless if not backed by deeds. We see this daily in our fellowship where some stand in the midst of the assembly and pours out their needs! In our case, beloved what do we do? We are simply asked to stand and “ commit the sister/brother to the Lord’s care”. <br><br>A long twenty to thirty-minute prayer is said citing and quoting copious verses of scriptures to remind God (as if He has forgotten)  that he must meet the needs of the one with the request. <br><br>We even issue as it were a “ veiled threat “ in our prayers by asking  Him to act to avoid disgrace before unbelievers. Who will ask “Where is our God?” <br><br>After the prayer as usual we walk to the needy to shake his/her hands and console and comfort him/her with more words; not a hint or personal assurance of help from us. <br><br>This is what James was alluding to; read it <br>James 2:16 <br>NIV<br>[16] <b>If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed</b>,” <br><br>Nyamè wô hô ôbè yè! Fama Nyame! Ôtsèsô Nyamè wô tsè à aboà entetià sô nyà bî ( forgive my poor twi!) <br><br>There have been instances where some have refused to tell their congregation the sufferings they are going through   When asked why, they replied  “ I know them they hear but do nothing! So I am better off not telling them”. O! <br><br>Yes,  beloved this is what happens when words mean nothing but sounds to some, and because they would not want their ears to be disturbed they prefer not to open up! <br><br>There is a need for us individually and collectively to examine ourselves concerning these ! Words without acts mean nothing but mere sounds to a sufferer. This trend of behaviour is very high among us. <br><br>The Apostle John also saw what James experienced; read how he put it; <br><br>1 John 3:18<br> NIV<br>[18] Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.<br><br>I, John (the minister) have also seen and continue to experience this hence what you’ve just read.

Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.<br><br>A Refreshing place to be! <br><br>So what is the essence of this article? To let you know that Jesus loved nature, visited and relaxed his mind and spirit! You too find time to do the same.  <br><br>Here is one that will not cost you anything; take a trip to Mamfe, drive down through the forest to Tinkong, onward to Koforidua and back. You’ll be refreshed! <br><br>I patronized these routes on several occasions on my way to Kumasi and can attest. <br><br>Or drive through Shai towards Asutuare junction pause along the route to take in fresh air and enjoy the sight and breeze. I experienced these many years ago to Akosombo  and can attest <br><br>Yes, identify and patronize your “Gethsemane” but do not forget your Judas knows there and will one day give you away! It happened to Jesus, it can and will happen to you.  So be on guard. A word to the wise!! <br><br>Thoughts to share. <br>John Franklin Tamakloe<br>",

    "text": "2 Corinthians 7<br>KJV<br>1+ Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<br><br>This appeal by Paul continues to be valid and of great relevance today. He made mention of two types of “ filth “ the filthiness of the flesh “ and that of the “ spirit “ ! <br><br>Indeed as our cities and surroundings are engulfed by material ( physical )  filth even so are some fellowships engulfed with spiritual filth. <br><br>What is worrying is just like how we can live the filth in our community without raising a voice; even so, we can live with the spiritual filth that surrounds us in the fellowship without raising a voice. <br><br>Like society, dare to raise a voice and you’ll be shot down even so it is in some fellowships.  <br><br>But what is  “filthiness of the flesh ?” Simply put anything that contaminates and works against the natural purpose and use of the flesh. This definition is broad so you can fill in the specifics. <br><br>Any moral conduct, behavior etc that contradicts the normal, acceptable standard is a filthiness Of the flesh. <br><br>Paul gives a clue, read it <br>Romans 1<br>KJV<br>26+ For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<br><br>27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<br><br>Any abuse ( two words put together; abnormal and use =abuse, abnormal usage ) of nature results in “filthiness of the flesh” such as “gratifications” <br><br>Paul is saying, dear believer now that you have switched sides by your conversion do away with any form of abuse that will make you fleshly filthy. <br><br>Filthiness of the flesh therefore has to do with moral and ethical failure. <br><br>Do not forget, He has said ;<br>2 Corinthians 5<br>KJV<br>17+ Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things have become new.<br><br>What about “ filthiness of spirit?” This has to do with spiritual contamination, some things contaminate the spirit, negative things that take place inside us. <br><br>Our evil thoughts and minds about someone or something etc. A contaminated spirit can not pray to God and expect to be heard. A contaminated spirit (heart)  can not offer an acceptable sacrifice ( worship ) to God<br><br>Read what Jesus said about the filthiness of the spirit and what it can not do.  <br><br> Matthew 6<br>KJV<br>14+ For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:<br><br>15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.<br><br>Ever wondered why your prayers are not answered? Well, among other reasons it is the spiritual filth ( hatred, envy, jealousy, evil speaking etc) that is in your heart against someone which is the reason. Your spirit is contaminated, it is filthy <br><br>Another example of spiritual filth; <br>Matthew 5<br>KJV<br>23+ Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;<br><br>24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<br><br>With a spiritually filthy heart, how can one’s sacrifice be accepted? <br><br>Finally, spiritual filth includes dabbling in spiritism and consulting with spiritualists, to invoke curses on perceived enemies. <br><br>Beloved, this is what Paul meant by his appeal ; <br><br>2 Corinthians 7:1 <br>NIV<br>[1] Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God<br><br>Let us rid ourselves of any filth be it fleshly or spiritual. <br><br>Thoughts to share. <br><br>John Franklin Tamakloe.<br>",

He tells it as it is and calls a spade a spade.</p><p>How I wish I could leave behind my diaries to be read by all just like he has done with his titled Ecclesiastics! I’ve been working on mine for many years now! Hmmm! Enyè easy!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the two verses above he confirms what is true but often inadmissible by many. There is no perfect man on earth, we are all “ striving” and “learning” to be! Each one is at one stage higher or lower than the other! This is a fact of life!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7:20&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[20] Indeed, there is no one on earth who is righteous, no one who does what is right and never sins.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve heard it said, “Whatever you do people will talk about you !” Have you asked why? This happens because those who are at your level of maturity understand and appreciate you whereas those below will condemn and speak evil of you! It is as simple as this</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is so because their level of understanding, knowledge and experience is lower than yours. If they wear the shoes you wore, stand where you stood, hear what you heard, and see what you saw and know what you knew ; they’ll appreciate and make informed comments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But quite often this is not the case &nbsp;It is for this reason that Solomon advised;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 7:21&nbsp;<br>NIV<br>[21] *Do not pay attention to every word people say*, or you may hear your servant cursing you---</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is not “every word, “ they say which is relevant some may others may not. Take the relevant and throw the irrelevant into the trash basket! In other words, do not take them to heart.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This calls for discernment, the ability to discern what is and what is not, and here lies the difficulty!&nbsp;<br><br>To the immature and unwise everything said ( words) is relevant. So he ends up hearing his servant cursing him which makes him go mad!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If only we could apply the “Solomonic” formula and advice to tell the relevant from the irrelevant it would help us know who to listen to or not. It is not everything said by everybody that matters.&nbsp;<br>Some things said by some matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to know where this approach is more pronounced and applicable then it is the political arena. Whatever a ruling government says or does the opposition will say the contrary. Some of the “ contrary “ statements, suggestions etc will make sense others non-sense!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved do not give ear to everything said about you, you know yourself better than they do. Listen to some, ignore others. Move on with your life, always remember people’s level of maturity informs what they see and what they say!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You owe no one an explanation except God! He will judge you according to what He knows about you He will not call any to tell Him anything about you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 Corinthians 5<br>KJV<br>10+ For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 14<br>KJV<br>10+ But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe</p>",

The impossibility thinkers!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>May we learn to speak words of encouragement to those who are undertaking tasks that will bring hope to us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second important lesson Peter’s response and subsequent actions teach us is the need to be <strong>discerning and flexible.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Peter knew who Jesus was so he was willing to act on his directive.&nbsp; Some in his shoes would have turned down His directive. These will say “ We ( experts ) have toiled all night catching nothing; who are you and what do you know about fishing?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, we hear this said to many today. “Who are you to say this or that ??”I like the word Peter used” <strong>Nevertheless</strong>” Yes, nevertheless, regardless of who or what “ I will give it a try”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Come to think of it, Jesus did not say anything Peter didn’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><blockquote><p>4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context seems to suggest that Peter and his crew had earlier gone on a fishing expedition which resulted in nothing. So they berthed their boats and washed their nets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><blockquote><p>Luke 5:2-3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[2] He saw at the water's edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[3] He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The earlier expedition brought nothing but disappointment, this explains the reason Peter said what he said. He initially doubted, he is human just like us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But he quickly discerned and was flexible in thought and decision. Here is where he puts many of us to shame probably including you! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dear reader be discerning and flexible in life After all you lose nothing by giving a suggestion a trial!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Discernment and flexibility are signs of growth and maturity, whereas fanaticism is a sign of the opposite.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Come to think of it Jesus did not say anything strange or new.&nbsp; Peter knew and understood what he suggested.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Luke 5:4&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[4] When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Deep Water Oooh” that was what he suggested to Peter. Something Peter knew from experience but probably overlooked.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How many times have we not been reminded of something we knew but overlooked which is key to our succeeding in an undertaking?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this not what is meant by “ Sankofa ?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These two lessons I learnt from reading this incident which I share with you I hope it helps!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>If you have nothing positive to say keep quiet.&nbsp;</li><li>Be discerning and flexible in thought and decisions.

    "text": "<p>I Want To Know What Love Is</p><p>1 John 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Apostle John was an eyewitness to the life of Jesus; he observed Him from a close range. As such, his writings reflect the very detailed life that Jesus led.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As is known he was the disciple who was described as the one “who leaned on his breast at supper”&nbsp; &nbsp;Read it&nbsp;</p><p>John 21</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you recall it was only John who wrote what has become the profound test of knowing what love is. Please read it?&nbsp;</p><p>John 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His epistles therefore are the account of his experiences and observations of the love that Jesus taught and practiced. It is these that informed our text for this write-up Regarding the title, listeners of music will know that it was the title of a popular hit many years ago. ( Foreigner -1984)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you want to know what love is? Then here is how it is manifested by anyone who claims to love you. Is he/she willing to “lay down his/her life “ for you?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 3:16 NIV</p><p>[16] This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To make sure his readers do not confuse what he means by “ laying down “ Of life, he added the following;&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 3:17&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[17] If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context therefore gives us the meaning of those words. There is no ambiguity about what John meant. No one can say he does not understand what he meant. When we give to someone what is of great value, to enhance his life or lift him from a low level we are “ laying down our life” for the recipient!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are too many fake, hypocritical and pretentious acts parading as love which must be exposed. These are mainly words coined to deceive and mislead the unsuspecting. Some mistook “ admiration “ for love. Which is not, unless backed with action; admiration is mere words!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John cautioned against this; read it ;&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 3:18-19&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[18] Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. [19]&nbsp;</p><p>This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A genuine action, from a genuine heart, motivated and inspired by genuine&nbsp;</p><p>concern and love for the recipient or beneficiary! This is what love is!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a practical note to illustrate, recently I was bereaved and many were those who sent their “ condolences “ my inbox was full! On the day of the funeral only a few of the many “ condolencers” showed up.&nbsp; Their “ condolences “ were mere words because they failed to translate them into deeds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you remember what John said?</p><p>1 John 3:18&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Translate your “ condolences “ into deeds this is what it means to &nbsp;“lay down one’s life”! A condolence is a sympathy, deeds (actions) translate sympathy into empathy. Beloved, sympathy and empathy are not the same, Many sympathize, only a few empathize&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With this experience, I was approached a few days ago by a brother who want to publish my second bereavement which just occurred on a platform, unfortunately, I turned down the request. I told him my inbox will be full of “condolences “ which will result in no show on the day of burial. Yes, these &nbsp;are hard and unpleasant truths known to all . Beloved, I want to know what love is!&nbsp;<br><br>We have loved each other by words for far to long, that a mere expression of sympathetic words &nbsp;( a condolence ) is interpreted as love! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Valley Of Decision!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In every man’s life, there comes a moment that demands action—a decisive moment that, if left unattended, can lead to a lifelong disaster!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the Valley of Decision, we are confronted with questions that have to do with our destiny. Questions that have to do with our spiritual, economic, social etc destinies.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decisions and choices we make will shape our life’s destinies. What we are today reflects the choices we made in the past.. What we shall be tomorrow is based on what we do or don’t do today</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some choices are irreversible and so are some decisions. Ask any aged person and he /she will confirm this to you. This is because he/she has once walked through the Valley of Decision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every step we take in every hour or day forms part of the building blocks we lay for our future. The entire structure of the building will be completed at our old age. It is for this reason that we must weigh carefully the choices we make.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It must be admitted, many of us (including this writer ) have made some irreversible choices, the consequences of which are with us today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Human as we are we can not escape such mistakes. We just have to accept and live with them till we sleep one night and wake up no more! . Though a difficult and daunting task yet we have no choice but to face it squarely&nbsp; &nbsp;To procrastinate is to postpone what will catch up with us later&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walking through the Valley of Decision in life, beloved requires help. Hear how someone who once walked through this Valley concluded;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalms 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rod and staff here indicate, training, guidance and discipline. Read a few ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Job 5</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>17</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 3</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>11</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction:</p><p><strong>12</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Hebrews 12</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>5</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:</p><p><strong>6</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Corinthians 11</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>32</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He acknowledged and attributed his successful walk through this Valley to God. “I will fear no evil, for thou art with me” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, it is only with the presence of God in our lives, and the help of the Holy Spirit that we can walk successfully through the Valley of Decision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Holy Spirit will illuminate both the eye and the mind guiding and granting us the ability to discern so we make the right decisions and choices. He does these through the Word and promptings! A key feature in the believer’s daily walk with God which unfortunately the majority overlook! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Valley of Decision is a valley that some have visited and climbed out of, Make every effort to walk through it successfully!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>If you ever find yourself in the Valley of Decision do not panic seek help when and where necessary. &nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The answer I usually get always points to the “ingredients “ used.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am told by the “experts” that for a meal to pass the test, it must have the right proportions of ingredients.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I found this knowledge relevant and applicable to life. For any life to be called a good life it must have in proportion all virtues. Virtues such as honesty , trustworthiness , politeness , respectfulness etc. Most important of all is “self-restraint”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As the above scriptures state, “self-restraint” “ self rule “and “self-control” must be part of what it takes to be a good-natured man.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To hold one’s spirit in check no matter what the situation may be, is more to be preferred than anything else.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>32+ He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It does not take much to take a city but it takes much to rule one’s spirit. To take a city is an external warfare but to rule one’s spirit is internal which is the toughest. This explains why not many can rule their spirits!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be unable to rule one’s spirit is simply to be lacking in character, unprincipled, because <strong>character is the anchor that holds a person in check amid human storms!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may have been at some meetings where there were outbursts, tempers flaring and the atmosphere was thick and tense. This is because someone failed to ‘rule his spirit’!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be around people who have mastered the art of self-restraint is a joy and a delight, Conversations and discussions are conducted in a low tone! &nbsp;Anything said no matter how unpleasant does not provoke outbursts, silence is maintained! Each at the meeting has learned to swallow his pride!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take note, when two people standing close to each other speak (shout) to each other in a high tone then know that they are out of sync. They’ve both failed to rule their spirits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, how do we self-restrain (rule) our spirits? It begins with self-respect which is then extended to others.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next is acceptance; to accept that all men are not the same in terms of thought and practice; there will always be differences. Make room for divergent views and opinions, speak/express yours respectfully and politely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not everyone knows what you know, In life some are above you, while others are below in many respects. So factor this into your dealings with people. Learn from the one above you, and teach the one below you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learn to agree, and or disagree, know what is essential and what is not.&nbsp; In essentials stand firm on nonessential give way to liberty!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walk away from anyone who is lacking in character and is unprincipled!

Their pursuit of keeping drainages open and clean has won them national recognition&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This also confirms what the writer of the Proverbs letter said ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 21</p><p>KJV</p><p>21+ He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That we get what we deserve as a result of what we do is a true observation in life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow the path of evil and you’ll get evil paid back to you. In the same way as following the path of righteousness, you’ll get righteousness credited in return.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question then is which path are we walking, and where is it leading to? Pause for a moment to think over this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few “ follow afters” that are worth considering ;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>19+ Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalms 34</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Hebrews 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever we sow, knowingly or unknowingly (good or bad) we shall receive payments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A testimony to share&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

As a primary school pupil, these writings served as reading exercises as we learn to read. There were many such inscriptions; as they were the fashion of the time, owners used their vehicles to express their thoughts, feelings and sentiments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But truly speaking nothing is permanent in life not even relationships. Some we forget as we move on in life and our associations change; others we break as goals, interests, values and aspirations change. The worst of which is when a friend becomes an enemy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that what unites us as friends is our shared interests, goals, values, principles etc Whenever there is a shift or change in any of these we part company. This definition of friendship is what the prophet Amos gave&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Amos 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>3 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though this can be heartbreaking and a source of worry, we take consolation in what Solomon once said regarding the non-permanency of everything. Hence to be forewarned is to be forearmed; read it ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 3:8&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[8] a time to love and a time to hate, a time for war and a time for peace.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All that is needed is for one to be prepared for any such situation, this way one can move on in life.

No one comes to the Father except through me.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I remember when I first arrived in Headington, Oxford I stayed on campus for a few days without going to the city centre though I needed a few items for use The reason was simple, I didn’t know how to get around! I felt shy to ask for help.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was no Google Maps at the time. It had not yet been invented or created.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a day or two when life was getting rough due to my lacking these basic items, I decided to go out on my own. And guess what I got lost. I struggled to find my way back to campus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the first weeks when lectures began, I made friends with some African students, fortunately, some lived in England so they knew their way around places.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first thing they suggested to me was to buy a guidebook. Interestingly there are guidebooks covering the entire country, mainly focused on streets. If you are in Oxford there is one solely for use there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, they also made me know that I can approach any Policeman I meet and ask for directions. Something I did when I visited London! Though some helped, others confused me the more!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully I bought a copy which settled my fear of getting lost in town! I bought those of other county’s I visited during my stay&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To know one’s destination especially how to get there is very important in life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same applies to Christianity, Jesus once told his disciples “You know the way to the place where I am going.”! He didn’t land when one ( Thomas) raised his hands to say Massa (sic) “&nbsp;</p><p>Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you notice? He said they don’t know the “ where “ and the “ how”. A destination is made up of two things the place and the how to get there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I guess you’ve heard said “ if you don’t know where you are going any direction to take will lead you there “&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is one thing to know the place and another to know how to get there! We know a place by hearing others tell us of it. This is a theoretical approach, which creates in us a desire to visit the place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We know Heaven through the stories and descriptions the scriptures provide! Read the book of Revelation and some of the things Jesus said about the place in the Gospels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Critical to the issue is how to get there. Here is where mankind is divided. Though everyone would love to be there, sadly only a few will make it. Why? Because they are not paying attention to the map!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was to avoid this that Jesus explicitly said “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rest my case. Want to go to Heaven? Here is the answer to the question “How do I get there ?” The Guide Book is the Scriptures, consult it regularly as you travel the way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There may be junctions or bypasses etc make sure you don’t miss them. Most importantly always keep your eyes on the road!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How long are you going to be here is a question no one can answer! Many have tried but to no avail. Even medical practitioners have told some that they will leave within a few months but this has turned into years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The transient and impermanent nature of our stay is what James described as a “ vapour” A vapour is a mist, it rises and within seconds vanishes into thin air. Life if compared to a flower, it grows, blossoms, gives out fragrance and thereafter withers! Who knows at which stage of this plant you are at this moment in life?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Compared to the grass here is what Peter said about life;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Peter 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>24+ For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our beauty, handsomeness, glory, fame, popularity etc will fade with time!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Isaiah was told “ Cry” and he asked what he was to say read what he was told;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Isaiah 40</p><p>KJV</p><p>6+ The voice said, Cry.

Peter tried to ask this very question though he didn’t put it directly; a careful reading of the conversation between him and Jesus indicates that was his intended question&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>John 21:20-23&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[20] Peter turned and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following them. (This was the one who had leaned back against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is going to betray you?”)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[21] When Peter saw him, he asked, “Lord, what about him?”</p><p>[22] Jesus answered, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[23] Because of this, the rumor spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus did not say that he would not die; he only said, “If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, yes the duration of our stay here is unknown as is testified to by the variations in ages we see on the funeral posters/banners of those who have been recalled! The obituary notifications.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This being the case beloved, let us make the most out of what time we are allotted! It is true none can initiate and complete whatever he/she desire; but initiate something anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is true you can not please or make everybody happy, but let a few feel happy and enjoy their time with you! This is how they will remember you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Impact a life for good and not evil! Let whatever duration you stay/spend here be meaningful! For we are here today, gone tomorrow!

[5] There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. [6] There are different kinds of working, but in all of them and in everyone it is the same God at work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As stated earlier the end goal of these services (gifts) is summed up by the Holy Spirit In these words ;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 12:7&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[7] Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read “ the common good “? They were meant to be used in a way that benefits everybody.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 4:12&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were therefore not given to provoke envy, jealousy or rivalry in the church; but to help build the Body of Christ.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now to the point of this writeup, some have asked why I don’t devote the time and platform to teaching “ doctrine”? By which they mean subjects such as “ baptism, weekly observance of the Lord’s Supper, giving, a cappella (unaccompanied) singing etc!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Good and relevant as these are, my target audience is not unbelievers but believers. My writings are meant to keep the saved safe. To mature them in the faith by living/leading lives that reflect their profession as believers. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My writings are inspired by the following scriptures ;&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 28</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Peter 2:2 NIV</p><p>[2] Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These and several other scriptures suggest that the saved must be kept safe, they will not be kept safe by repeatedly teaching the very same subjects that they believed and were brought into Christ. Baptism by immersion. Weekly Lord’s Supper etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are the “milk, &nbsp;“bones, meat” subjects which suggest the need for a progressive growth and development of every believer. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The continuous emphasis and teaching of these elementary subjects (post-baptism) have resulted in a lack of growth ( maturity ); evidence of which we encounter every day among us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Hebrew writer encountered a similar situation hence he wrote;&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this not a true reflection of how many look? Read how he described some of us;&nbsp;</p><p>13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, what a sad description!

Read how he concluded ;&nbsp;</p><p>14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grow your faith, that is what He means!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, my writings are meant to turn “spiritual children” into “spiritual adults”! It does not come to me as a surprise when some don’t read them because they are content with being “spiritual infants” in Christ. A condition that manifests itself in how they behave and conduct themselves in the Assembly even though they have been in Christ for a long time!.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are wondering or asking why I don’t write about baptism, the Lord’s Supper, etc it is because some are teaching them. These are foundational settings, after which I lay blocks of “Christian character” to complete the spiritual building!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who teach such subjects and I are working together. We are both collaborating to build the church of God. Without them I can not lay the blocks of Christlike character which my writings are meant to be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This also explains why I am not into “ controversies “ but rather what will build a believer in word and deed. Lifestyle. I have defined my target audience, the post-baptized believer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I do not write to answer “ what must I do to be saved ?” I write to answer “What must I do to remain saved ?” &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My answer to any who wish to know why I write what I write!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>At The Pleasure Of God</p><p>Romans 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>8+ For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Having lived through different political administrative dispensations spanning seven decades one certain thing, among several others is the transitional nature of holding a political office.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is no permanency in political appointments. Every appointee holds his/her office at the pleasure of the president or the appointing authority.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may have heard it said, “ the president appoints and dis-appoints”. Indeed contrary to what some may think or believe. No condition is permanent, positions are not possessions! Everyone serves at the pleasure of somebody&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the same applies to our walk and work with God, He alone “appoints and dis-appoints”. We live and serve at His pleasure. He “ ordains and dis-ordains”! None can query or fight Him over his “appointment and or dis-appointment “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read again what Paul said ;</p><p>Romans 14:8&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[8] If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. So, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are His to use as He wishes, He made us to serve His purposes on Earth. So wherever you find yourself be it “pleasant or unpleasant” understand that you are there or in that situation because He wants to use YOU!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus once found himself in a “worrying” situation, Read what he said;&nbsp;</p><p>John 12:27&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[27] “Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read that “ it was for this very reason I came to this hour!”. Take note and be guided by this example!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Events that occur in the lives of the children of God are meant to serve a divine purpose. The difficulty we have is recognizing and knowing in advance that it is God’s will.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This may be difficult to accept by many but history and experience show how true this statement is. How many times, and at what point have you not quoted what Paul wrote regarding things that happen to us?&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>28+ And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“And we know “ at what time did we know; is it not after we have complained? Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, whatever purpose(s) for which God called you will work well for you in the end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If He takes you through “fire/heat “He will have His Hand on the thermostat, to regulate it. Is this not what He meant when He spoke through Isaiah; &nbsp;Read it,</p><p>Isaiah 43</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are unable to accept these assurances and live with them because of two things, fear and anxiety. Admittedly we are human, none is exempt! (Not even this writer !) Ours is to wait patiently which again is a difficult thing to do!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patience is required! To walk and serve God beloved patience is required. If we do not have patience we can not serve or walk with Him This writer learnt this the hard way ( and continues to learn) and can testify that it is true.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be honest, have you not ever said in private “Why is God slow in doing this or that for me?”&nbsp; Yes! To be patient is to wait and waiting for the majority is a challenge!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, how do we learn patience?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We do this by acknowledging that we are weak, do not know it all, can not do it on our own we need help, and this help will come from someone who will act when he has time for us. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether that someone will attend to us immediately or later, we don’t know it all depends on their time and not ours.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through experience, we have all been treated like this before. I have asked for help from some who acted on my request at the time they wished, even as I write some have but even said a word! Nor did they show any sign of attending to a request for help! I can not force or compel them. Mine is to wait and this is patience, painful as it may be!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, if we can wait patiently for humans to attend to our needs, then we can do the same with God. The difference is, though men may disappoint, He doesn’t! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us learn to resign our wills to Him. Yes, whether we live or die, we are His. We live and serve at His pleasure! He alone “ appoints, and or dis-appoints” To Him we owe everything!.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Owû mûô, nkwa muô Nipè ènÿè hô!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Partnering For Success</p><p>Exodus 17</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is undeniable that no one can single-handedly win any battle, a truth demonstrated by the record of how Israel won its battle against Amalek.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fierce was the battle, strong were the enemies that it became necessary that an unconventional tactic has to be deployed. A tactic that involved three Moses, Aaron and Hur.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The initial arrangement was that Moses was to stand on top of a hill to be visible to the Israeli forces under the command of Joshua. He was to carry with him the rod of office&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><p>Exodus 17:9&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[9] Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some of our men and go out to fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hands.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[10] So Joshua fought the Amalekites as Moses had ordered, and Moses, Aaron and Hur went to the top of the hill.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so it was when Israel engaged the Amalekites, however, a strange phenomenon was observed as the battle went on; whenever Moses lowered his hands the Amalekites broke through the Israelite defence and killed many</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it;</p><p>Exodus 17:11&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[11] As long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Moses, human as he is got tired of standing and holding high his hands and so the two men Aaron and Hur came to his assistance by first finding him a huge stone on which he sat and then holding his hands high in place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><p>Exodus 17:12</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] When Moses' hands grew tired, they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held their hands up---one on one side, one on the other---so that his hands remained steady till sunset.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, what a lesson! Oh how we miss this to our loss&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one has it all. No one knows it all. No one can do it all. Success is teamwork. Success comes through collaboration. Success comes when we unite our forces, talents etc each contributing their quota.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us look at the role each played in winning the battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First God, though not mentioned yet He featured prominently in the success of Israel&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was He who ordained and empowered Moses. The rod/staff in Moses’ Hand was the sign of God’s presence with him and His authority which he wielded.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second is Moses, as the leader he must be visible hence his position on top of the hill. For a team to be successful its leader must be visible at all times. A leader must inspire and encourage those he leads. This Moses did that day. He provided what is called today Inspirational leadership&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then thirdly, Aaron and Hur, these were subordinates, it was they who mooted the idea to get Moses seated comfortably. And also supported him by holding his two arms high in place so Israel could see and advance in the battle.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“They took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur held his hands up---one on one side, one on the other---so that his hands remained steady till sunset.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was no rivalry. There was no undermining, Aaron and Hur knew where they belonged. Aaron was an orator as we know from the pre-exodus account.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was the spokesperson when they appeared before the pharaoh. But he never used this endowment to challenge or undermine the authority of Moses, instead, he collaborated with him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hur, we know very little about him but from the accounts, he was one of the trusted aides to Moses At one point placed Israel under his care along with Aaron during his absence. Read it&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Exodus 24</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was a confidant of Moses and played this subordinate role with distinction. Can you as a confidant and an aide be trusted as Hur was?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To succeed in any endeavor there is a need for partnership. We must partner with one another to uplift the work of God. For this to become a reality we must recognize and know our place in the scheme of things.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The spirit of rivalry, competition, etc must never be part of the project. Pride and bloated egos must be buried.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like Israel, we shall win if those who lead us will cooperate, collaborate etc with each other.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We must also accept that in every human assembly, there must be a leader of leaders. “Primus inter pares” meaning “ first among equals “ &nbsp; It is from this Latin word that we got the term “Prime Minister” &nbsp; Failure to accept this arrangement is a recipe for failure&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Aaron and Hur recognized this which led to the success of Israel! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

John wrote “ he said “ all of them admit that something was said.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To know precisely what Jesus said we have to put all three accounts together; and this is how it reads “ It is finished: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit”:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember, all agreed that He gave up the ghost, but before doing so He said something!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of this write-up is to throw light on what some termed a contradiction and to show how such thoughts are resolved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many see these “missing links” in the account of the three writers as contradictions, when in fact they are not. Scriptures can not contradict themselves it is the untrained reader who sees it like that.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The example has always been given by referring to newspaper reporters A, B and C sent by different news organizations to cover an accident or an event.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each presented what he saw, and they will all report the same but they may differ in a few areas&nbsp; &nbsp;This is because each reporter may have in addition to what he saw interviewed some bystanders!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a scenario like this, no one can fault any of the reporters because they published different stories of the same event.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The similarities in their report show what was obvious to everyone. The dissimilarities are a result of the interviews they had with different bystanders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The rule is, to know what precisely took place one must put together the three reports published by the reporters. Similar to what you’ve just fine with the three Gospels&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear reader anytime you come across what may look to you as a “ contradiction” here is what is recommended that you do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, approach the issue with an open mind. Banish all biases, preconceived thoughts, conclusions or notions from your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, credit the Author of the Scriptures, in this case, God (Holy Spirit)! Who can not make a mistake&nbsp; &nbsp;He is all-knowing</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, look for verses, passages etc that contain similar thoughts; assemble all just as we’ve done above. Piece them together&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, seek help from historical documents that have something to do with the subject matter under discussion We call these “extra-biblical “ materials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is how we resolve what may appear to readers as biblical contradictions when in fact they aren’t.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this helps in knowing how to handle the seemingly contradictory verses in the scriptures&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Franklin Tamakloe&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Several examples abound in life as we see look-alikes. We also see these in professions, homes, and even in churches.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We become who we follow, as we step in, and walk in their footsteps consciously or unconsciously. I remember receiving a WhatsApp message from a relative telling me about someone she met who speaks and acts like me, and wanted to know if the person has been associated with me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The above scriptures make a similar case for believers as they behold the glory of God! As we read, hear, and meditate daily on the Word of God we experience transformations; we are changed to look like Him in character! We end up exhibiting godly character.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We become Christlike in word and deed as we stay closer to Him through His Word. His words influence our thoughts which translates into deeds. Remember, to walk with Jesus is simply to walk /live by what He taught.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is how observers will know if we are truly His followers.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Beloved how close we are to the Word is seen through how we do things! How we love, how we live, what fellowship we enjoy, what causes we support, what truths we uphold, where our loyalty lies etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A question that should engage our thoughts is, as men watch us what conclusions will they arrive at?

    "text": "<p>The Beauty Of Friendship: A Discovery. &nbsp;</p><p>2 John 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(The elder unto the elect lady and her children, a family )&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 John 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p><p>14 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p><p>(To Gaius )&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I took a few minutes to read through the two letters (2nd/3rd) of the Apostle John and found something of human interest, friendship; which I share with you&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like all of us, the Apostle John enjoyed the company of friends! These two letters, as indicated in their introductory and closing remarks, were written to two of his friends. One was a lady and her family, the other a gentleman named Gaius!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He has been corresponding with them through what we may call today a WhatsApp chat; but it got to a point where he felt it was necessary to visit them so they can sit, chat, eat and laugh!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What a thought! What a decision!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, has it ever occurred to you to visit the friend(s) you’ve only been chatting with over the years. ? At least to enjoy a “face-to-face “ fellowship? To recall the good old days, the school days, the village adventures, tell tolis etc! Just a look into each other's eyes is enough, a handshake and an embrace /hug mean a lot!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Apostle John was human just like any of us. He longed for a personal touch instead of the impersonal ( texts messages, forwarding, forwarding, phone calls)!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was touched by what I observed about the Apostle and began thinking of how I can put this into practice. That was when your thought came to mind that I should visit you! We've been chatting through WhatsApp only!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If only we can visit each other occasionally instead of the WhatsApp chats what a joy and happy moments we shall experience. We shall be revived not only emotionally but also spiritually!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Presently everyone is “busy” with something that is impersonal ( work) which brings no joy except money, and money can not buy genuine love or friendship which also explains why though we have the money we have no genuine friends!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(At least this is how I see it I may be wrong!)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Apostle John took time off writing (work) to visit, eat, chat and laugh with friends; so please expect my visit very soon!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you believe that the Apostle John took the right steps then do the same! Take time off your busy schedules and visit a friend (a genuine one) and enjoy each other’s company for at least two hours!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is what I took away after rereading the Apostle John’s letters! Very Interesting!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Did &nbsp;Jesus Have A Social Life?&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 11:19 NIV</p><p>[19] The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was an answer to a complaint or condemnation that the jews brought against Jesus. It was like He was saying “whatever you do people will talk about you. “ &nbsp; Let us put this in context by reading the preceding verses ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 11:16-19&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>\"To what can I compare this generation? They are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others: [17] \"'We played the pipe for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[18] For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' [19] The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.' But wisdom is proved right by her deeds.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever you want to call it the above gives us a bird’s eye view into the social life of Jesus. That Jesus led a low-key life is undisputed. He walked with and lived among the despised, rejected, looked-down-upon members of society as confirmed by what was said concerning him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Jewish bourgeoisie found His association with the lowly unacceptable! They felt he was debasing the status and lowering the class, image, esteem etc that religious leaders are held. He was a disgrace to religious leadership!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read this ;</p><p>Luke 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him.</p><p>2+ And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They even queried and questioned his disciples about this. Read it;</p><p>Mark 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unknown to them Jesus overheard what they were saying to his disciples and turned round to answer them. Read it;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>17 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He said in today’s language “ I came not to call the holier than thou’s!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truly if He were to be with us today He would love to eat at the chop bars and not restaurants let alone at Kempiski! He would love to take for breakfast koko and massa, instead of baked beans, fried eggs and toasted bread!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am not by any means saying these are bad please, (I do enjoy the same from time to time resource permitting )because He attended parties, ate at the home of some well-to-do members of society &nbsp; These were exceptions and not the rule.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, Jesus had a social life. He attended Jewish social gatherings such as weddings where songs are sung, people dance, celebrity singers, comedians etc are invited to perform!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Look for and read if you can &nbsp;“Sketches Of Jewish Social Life In The Days Of Christ by Alfred Edersheim)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today some believers have no social life simply because it is seen and regarded as evil and satanic. To sit at a table at a wedding party with someone unknown or who does not attend his fellowship is a sin.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To play and listen to a song by Tracy Chapman ( Words don’t come easily ) Boney M ( by the rivers of Babylon) James Brown ( Say It Loud) Wilson Pickett (Midnight Hour) Percy Sledge ( Take time to know her) all these are sinful&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To go out with loved ones to eat banku and tilapia at a kenkey joint, to go to the gym and exercise (or at home) with a secular song in the background to help the step-by-step movements during the exercise and make the practice pleasant is evil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It must always be “ Jerusalem My Happy Home, Blest Be The Tie ( meanwhile the tie that binds is a curse and questionable!)! Yes, these are beneficial and have a place but are the spiritual, not the social life. Many have mistaken the spiritual for the social.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Man must have both the spiritual and the social not leaving out the economic life. We go to work ( economic) we attend church ( the spiritual) we must also sit, eat,&nbsp; chat,&nbsp; laugh etc ( Social)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the scriptures, it is evident that Jesus had a social life. Do you have a social life?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts.&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Load Shedding: A Christian Perspective&nbsp;</p><p>Galatians 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Thessalonians 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Galatians 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>21+ And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The expression “ load shedding “ is a much dreaded expression that almost every Ghanaian hate to hear! Some call it “ domsor!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Load shedding was an exercise introduced by the power-generating companies as a way of rationing the limited power they can generate. It was a “burden sharing “ exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This took place at a time when the economy was not in good shape and generating inputs were not available so power plants could not operate at full capacity. Time tables ( schedules) were published and reviewed weekly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is the hardship and discomfort that this exercise imposed on the citizenry that made the term “ load shedding” repugnant and nobody wants to hear it again&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But come to think of it, the power producers were only complying with what the scriptures enjoined us believers to do-share with others the limited available resources&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the power rationing period the communities were zoned and power was supplied in an alternative fashion. Zone A gets it for a certain duration. After which Zone B and thereafter Zone C!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In effect, we were “ bearing one another’s burden” sharing the discomfort and inconvenience in a way as not to disadvantage anybody. No one must be left in darkness which is exactly what the above scriptures teach.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No one must go to bed on an empty stomach. No one must be denied pleasure or enjoyment; all must enjoy no matter the degree or different levels of enjoyment. The bottom line is that everyone must be happy. This is what “ Bear year one another’s burden “ means.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the above scriptures have one thing in common ; load ( burden )&nbsp; sharing ! Those who have must support those who don’t have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>John spoke to this subject more practically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Read it</p><p>1 John 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>17+ But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>James also added his voice to burden sharing when he asked ;</p><p>James 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</p><p>16+ And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our rural communities, we see this ( burden sharing ) in action, The following are shared; poverty is shared, pain is shared, sorrow is shared, Joy is shared! When one suffers all suffer, when one is blessed all share in it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We also see these among genuine friends and lovers; when one is down all help to lift him. When one suffers a mishap all rally round to offer help.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not so among many believers! To them, it is “ everybody for himself, God for us all” &nbsp; Every body for himself, God for us all is an economic philosophy the practice of which creates individual wealth, which &nbsp; eventually divides society as a result of the wide&nbsp; gap between the&nbsp; haves and the have-nots &nbsp; a source of social inequality&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas “ burden sharing “ is a philosophy that creates social equality regardless of the prevailing economic inequality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Burden sharing therefore is a social philosophy the pursuit of which will lead to social peace and harmony. The apostles practised this; read the outcome&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</p><p>35+ And laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</p><p>( Burden sharing in action )&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is my view that many mistook an economic philosophy for the social. Everybody for himself, God for us all is not a social bug an economic philosophy! It is a driving force behind wealth creation&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we therefore desire to create a community of love, just, equal etc then we must revisit the concept of “ load shedding “ ( burden sharing ) where generated power was rationed so no one was left in total darkness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts as I reread the scriptures that command us to “ bear ye one another’s burden “. Bear ye one another’s burden is a social philosophy, not an economic one. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pursue the everybody for himself, God for us all philosophy to create wealth, after which you practice the social philosophy of “ burden sharing” where you share with the disadvantaged what wealth you’ve created.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

In the face of the realities of life we are not immune, no one can deny the fact that he/she have not experienced disappointments in life. We are flesh and blood! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we are immune because of the faith that lives in us. We are immune by virtue of the trust we have in God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is faith that immunizes us, the heavier the dose the better our chances are of withstanding the shocks of life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is where many are found lacking, Beloved any time you are sinking below the pressures and cares of life, please check your dosage of faith level it may be that they’ve gone low or down completely!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To overcome, you’ll need to increase the dosage. You must maintain a level that will sustain and support you, always take a booster dose from time to time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This you do by setting aside a day to fast, pray and read the Bible not for anything but to boost your spiritual immune system.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read John said,</p><p>1 John 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. 1 John 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Faith is the victory we know that overcomes the world! So always check your faith level lest it fail you at the time you most need it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved,&nbsp; there are two tools God gave us which we have, in our armoury; these are ‘reason’ and ‘faith’! Human effort is based and grounded in reasoning, the application of the mind, the intellect, experience etc to solve a problem Reason therefore is the first tool to apply when you encounter any challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second tool is faith. This comes into play where and when reason has failed. This is because human reasoning has its limits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read what Paul said;&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>7+ (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read that “ we walk by faith “ ? Yes, when walking by “sight” (reason) fails that is when we walk by “ faith “. There is a limitation to human reasoning, but there is no limitation to faith in God. The greater the faith the greater the victory. So, grow your faith not forgetting to grow your reasoning ability also.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, troubles will come our way because we are human but we are equipped to overcome them through faith and reason. Reason on our part and faith in God. Remember these two tools learn when, where and how to use them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Israel’s Wilderness Journey: What It Means To Us Today</p><p>Exodus 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, the promised land was a few miles away, just a stone’s throw as we would say it in today’s language, and yet Israel was taken through a different route.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reason was given as “ Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, God’s intention or reason for taking them the other way was to teach them lessons! Lessons they’ll need as they settle in the land.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps you may not understand God's intention. Look at it this way: Historically, Israel ( Jacob) came to Egypt at Joseph's invitation!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>History gives us the number that came with him. There were in total seventy.&nbsp;</p><p>Genesis 46</p><p>KJV</p><p>26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>27+ And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But after many years when they were leaving Egypt scriptures state&nbsp; the following;&nbsp;</p><p>Deuteronomy 10</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now the Lord thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Exodus 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>37+ And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seventy (70) went in, six hundred thousand (600,000) came out excluding children. A nation was born.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A nation was born, organization was needed. Laws ( a constitution) to regulate and hold the nation were needed. Structures and institutional arrangements are needed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These were the reasons why they were taken through the long route to enable them to learn the lessons of nationhood! Hitherto they were a disorganized clan groupings with no cohesion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do we stand to learn from these experiences? A lot.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Individually we need to know that though God has plans for our lives these will not materialise if He does not first take us through some rigorous training.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ask anybody who is “ well to do “today and he/she will tell you how far he/she has come. The ups and downs, the rise and fall, the pains and the sufferings. The disappointments and regrets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, God will not give you precious things if you fail His training. If you’ve not learn how to handle GHC10, He will not give you GHC 100&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this not what Jesus meant when He said;&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 16:10-12</p><p>NIV</p><p>[10] “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[11] So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? [12] And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many a child of God has asked why they are going through difficulties in life when they ought to be enjoying! What you’ve just read is the answer. You are simply not faithful in the little blessings He bestowed on you. Yes, the truth is painful but that is it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just look at how employees handle the properties of their employers. Just watch how people entrusted with little authority exercise it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just look at how some tenants handle the rooms they rent. Just watch how some taxi drivers handle the taxis they are given to drive. You’ll often hear them say “ oh if I buy my own you’ll see how I’ll handle it” which wish never comes because they are dishonest with someone else’s. Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you now see why some are unable to make progress in life? Because they fail the training lessons of God. The little blessings God blessed them with were either misapplied or misused.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The subject paper in which most believers had zero was that of benevolence. They passed papers in church attendance, taking the Lord's Supper, not giving tithes, not using instruments in singing, you name it!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They failed miserably in the benevolence papers. They failed in both papers one and two. &nbsp; Paper one they had -selfishness, paper two -selfishness These were written across their answer sheets.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is what was written boldly underneath their papers as the answers expected; read it.&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>24+ There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>26+ He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some gave up on the training. To them, the envisaged training is too tough so they did not attempt it at all. The one talented man was their role model so they had nothing to their credit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Others attempted but failed because they misused their first credit (blessing) through selfishness! Remember what Jesus said&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 16:10</p><p>NIV</p><p>[10] “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, the lesson is this God takes us through the “ wilderness “ of pain/suffering etc to see how we would use whatever He will bestow on us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not many were born with silver spoons in their mouths; you may be one but today look at the type of spoon that is in your mouth! Is it silver,&nbsp; wooden or none&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those born without silver spoons in their mouths but now have them are those who passed the test of honesty, faithfulness. Etc. &nbsp;They were faithful in little hence they were blessed with more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always remember that when God takes you through the “wilderness” it was to prepare you for a better future! So do not be afraid to go through the wilderness. Let me conclude with this promise!&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremiah 29</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trust God to take you through the wilderness safely till you set foot in the promised land of greatness and glory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p>",

What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.)</p><p>(KJV)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was many decades ago, in fact in my youthful days that these words were drummed into my ears; to the intent that I should not seek fame or popularity the wrong way. &nbsp;Human endorsement through the wrong means/reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those were the days, just like it is today that everybody wants to be somebody! Everybody wants to be seen, and be regarded as “somebody” and to achieve this one has to do something weird and unusual!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like today, morality was turned upside down through the wearing of special hairstyles, indecent clothing, and vulgar appearances with earrings tucked in men’s ears. Men plaiting their hair just like women.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At that time it was on a minimal scale not full-blown as today. Surely this way you’ll attract attention and be seen as different. This was an era we called the “ justify your inclusion” era “be in or be left out.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few drifted and joined the “immoral revolution” instead of upholding the “ moral revolutionary principles “ bequeathed This was how we got to where we are today. A generation failed to uphold, protect and defend values that was bequeathed to them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today the unacceptable of the past has become acceptable. Men wearing earrings were unknown then, and men with unkempt beards and hair were unknown then. What we now know as “Rasta hairstyle” was the preserve of the mentally challenged.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wearing trousers with cuts/holes all over was also the preserve of the mentally challenged! Wearing and exposing undergarments as outer covering, even the bras of women were concealed. Not anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today you must expose the “not to be exposed” in public, “do the not to be done “ in public “ behave unbehavingly (sic) ” in public etc; all in the name of seeking attention, popularity and recognition! Validation is the word.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What made many uncomfortable then, makes the majority comfortable today. The apologists of these would say “ society is dynamic, social change is inevitable”&nbsp; which is true; but social values are non-negotiable, they are the basis of social cohesion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the sixties/seventies, there was this moral upheaval in the form of a lifestyle known as the hippie lifestyle. It was characterised by drug abuse, open confrontations with the law etc. It was a “ protest culture “ which is what every negative moral revolution is.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved in the midst of all these may we remember at all times and in all generations that “ What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>May we also note and observe these cautionary warnings ;</p><p>Romans 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Peter 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:</p><p>15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;</p><p>16+ Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like the psalmist, let us pray this prayer always ;</p><p>Psalms 51</p><p>KJV</p><p>10+ Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hope you’ll bear with the “lamentations” of the “old school boy”!

    "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I Want To Know What Love Is</strong></p><blockquote><p>1 John 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Apostle John was an eyewitness to the life of Jesus; he observed Him from a close range. As such, his writings reflect the very detailed life that Jesus led.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As is known he was the disciple who was described as the one “who leaned on his breast at supper”&nbsp; &nbsp;Read it&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>John 21</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you recall it was only John who wrote what has become the profound test of knowing what love is. Please read it?&nbsp;</p><p>John 15</p><blockquote><p>KJV</p><p>13+ Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His epistles therefore are the account of his experiences and observations of the love that Jesus taught and practiced. It is these that informed our text for this write-up Regarding the title, listeners of music will know that it was the title of a popular hit many years ago. ( <strong>Foreigner -1984</strong>)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you want to know what love is? Then here is how it is manifested by anyone who claims to love you. Is he/she willing to “lay down his/her life “ for you?&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:16&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To make sure his readers do not confuse what he means by “ laying down “ Of life, he added the following;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:17&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[17] If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person?</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context therefore gives us the meaning of those words. There is no ambiguity about what John meant. No one can say he does not understand what he meant. When we give to someone what is of value and importance, to enhance their life or lift them from a low level we are “ laying down our life” for the recipient&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are too many fake, hypocritical and pretentious acts parading as love which must be exposed. These are mostly words coined to deceive and mislead the unsuspecting. Some mistook “ admiration “ for love. Which is not, unless backed with action; admiration is mere words!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John cautioned against this; read it ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:18-19&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[18] Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. [19]&nbsp;</p><p>This is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A genuine action, from a genuine heart, motivated and inspired by genuine&nbsp;</p><p>concern and love for the recipient or beneficiary! This is what love is!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a practical note to illustrate, recently I was bereaved and many were those who sent their “ condolences “ my inbox was full I had a tough &nbsp;time deleting ! On the day of the funeral only a few of the many “ condolencers” showed up.&nbsp; Their “ condolences “ were love by words /speech because they failed to translate them into deeds. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you remember what John said?</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:18</p><p>NIV</p><p>Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, translate your “condolences “ into deeds This is what it means to “lay down one’s life”! A condolence It is a sympathy; it is deeds (actions) &nbsp;that translate sympathy into empathy. Beloved, sympathy and empathy are not the same. Many sympathize, only a few empathize&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With this knowledge and experience, I was approached a few days ago by a brother who wants to publish my second bereavement, which just occurred on a platform. Unfortunately, I respectfully turned down the request. I told him my inbox will be full of “condolences “ which will result in no show on the day of the burial.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seriously speaking, I can do without the expression of a condolence; what I can not do without is your presence. These are hard and unpleasant truths known to all but less expressed in the open. &nbsp;Beloved, I simply want to know what love is from you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is a prescription for anxiety, depression, hopelessness&nbsp; etc&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A careful look at the content suggests that the writer's thought was both reflective and futuristic. It embodies the psalmist's past, present, and future experiences and expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He is in effect saying “Because of what I have experienced with God, I am confident of the future”. Ever heard of the song “ because He lives, I can face tomorrow “Yes that’s the spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is exactly what the mind of every believer should be. Based on what we have experienced, we look forward with greater hope and encouragement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The picture or image painted by the verse is one of serenity.

That the writer wrote from experience is reflected by these verses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Otis Reading, the late soul singer who accidentally died in a plane crash (1967) wrote a song titled “Sitting on the Dock of the Bay “. A line that reads “ watching the ships roll by “ is a picture created from these verses.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there is soo much around us that God has freely given to us to revive and rejuvenate our spirits but we are not taking advantage of them.

The centurion believes that a word spoken by Jesus from a distance can resolve a problem or a challenge!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This expression of trust amazed Jesus so much that He reacted; read it,&nbsp;</p><p>10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isn’t it strange that people you walk or work with do not trust you but strangers do? Yes, such is life. Yes, this happens when you have fake and pretentious people around you pretending to be friends! In this case, the Jews had difficulty believing Jesus but not this stranger!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The centurion, a total stranger in Israel’s expression of faith in Jesus is summed up in these words of John ;&nbsp;</p><p>John 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ He came unto his own, and his own received him not. 12 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: 13+ Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That faith transcends ethnicity or tribe is emphasized by the thirteenth verse ;&nbsp;</p><p>13+ Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The centurion was not an Israelite but received the blessing and approval of God by faith. This is recorded to teach us that it is not all who say Lord Lord but those who believe and act on that belief! The centurion believed and acted on that belief.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read what Jesus said to him;&nbsp;</p><p>13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What took place that day fulfilled what was written several centuries before Christ ;</p><p>Psalms 107</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</p><p>21 Oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To understand what the psalmist meant by “ he sent his word “ you’ll have to read what John said concerning the “ word”. Who was that Word?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John 1:1,14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[1] In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [14] The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the Word that was sent to heal and deliver them from destruction as stated by the psalmist.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This incident also raises a lot of questions, that as believers we must answer. Beloved can men trust your words? Can someone walk away from you just because you’ve spoken? Does your word carry weight?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In case you don’t know, a word is a currency its value depends on your actions. The performance or otherwise of things you say adds value or devalues them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some people’s words are worthless, valueless and are rubbished. They are like a devalued currency because they are not backed by deeds. Is that you?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This centurion has watched Jesus from afar and has concluded that His words alone are valuable hence his insistence that he speaks just “ the word” and should not bother to come to his house.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, that men can believe our words and take them on face value! Just like you, I know people whose words I believe without a doubt; and some I doubt or take ‘with a pinch of salt!’&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear reader, your word is a currency therefore give it value by backing whatever you say with deeds. The more you back it with action the greater value and respect is attached to it. So much so that even on your sick bed your word alone can settle a debt or buy you medication from far.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ever heard the title “ òsèôdèôyò, that is the title of someone whose words ( currency) have high value because he backs them with deeds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be that person whose (Words) currency can be accepted and recognized everywhere as worthy and a legal tender!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Words words words! Read what Jesus said about the exchange rate of words!&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>37+ For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The exchange rate of your words fluctuates depending on your actions or inactions so be careful!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share, a challenge to all.&nbsp;</p>",

Plotting and planning evil against others as if they will have access to the properties of the one they plot against.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fact remains that if you harm or eliminate someone nothing of his will come to you. His knowledge, wealth, fame, wisdom, handsomeness, beauty etc will not come to you. You’ll still be the same.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes. Moses was right!</p><p>Psalms 90</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To apply one’s heart to wisdom is to be thoughtful, discerning, cautious etc in every step one takes in life. Yes take risks, but let them be “ calculated risk”. &nbsp;Even faith is not blind it is the assurance of things hoped for “ the evidence “ of things not seen”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life is not about “noise making”, it is not about “ rabble rousing “ it is about intelligent thinking, planning and living! It is about walking in the principles as taught by the Word of God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who numbers his days is like; &nbsp;</p><p>Psalms 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>3+ And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I rest my case. A word to the wise and discerning is enough!&nbsp;</p>",

Followers of my write-ups will recall I’ve discussed this subject before, many years ago! I am back again because many have asked to know if Jesus was a type, a celebrity etc!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In an age and time when men of God desire to be known, treated and revered as “ celebrities” the same can not be said of the Man whose servants they proclaim to be.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, Jesus did not leave us with a photograph or portrait but the descriptions the Holy Spirit gave us are enough to help us know what He looked like. One such passage that describes Him is what you’ve read above.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again ;</p><p>Isaiah 53:2&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[2] He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In case you are having difficulty identifying his description here is it,&nbsp;</p><p>“He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That he wasn’t a handsome man wielding any majestic influence etc is highlighted by the above scriptures!

A public display to enhance our superiority. He sat on a donkey with no one holding its rein, today we are chauffeur-driven, on some occasions with police escorts&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even when we arrive at venues we wait for some time before stepping out, and we have the doors open for us by bodyguards. Yes. Red carpets are strewn in our paths for us to walk on!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He sat and ate with the ordinary a practice we see as unfit and belittling; an anathema! He fraternize, socialized with the lowly an act we abhor. He avoided the limelight we invite and adore it. The tv cameras must be on us!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus was not a celebrity, He lived a simple lifestyle! I can hear some say, yes that’s true but times have changed! This is not true, he lived in a sophisticated and advanced culture and civilisation but none of these influenced him!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today’s men of God must return to the basics.

    "text": "<p>The Mystery Of A Day</p><p>Matthew 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>34+ Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I woke up to this verse firmly rooted in my mind, and I then paused to reflect and think of its meaning and implications. Here is what I came up with, which I share with you! What Is A Day?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A day is like a journey that begins from the very hour we wake. The moment your eyes open is as if you’ve landed at an airport and the plane has taxied to a stop.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Coming out of the bedroom is like walking through the arrival immigration checkpoint and your praying and composing yourself before you leave the bedroom is like collecting your luggage from the roller.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first person(s) you meet and greet are your arrival team waiting to receive and welcome you. Do you notice how every first morning greeting is said with a broad smile? Yes indicating joy and happiness for seeing each other. Just as happens at every reception point.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The newness and mystery of each day is like entering a town for the first time not knowing what goes on unless you get there. Everything you see or hear is new!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every day we see, we hear and we say new things. Every day’s experience is new!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A day is full of mysteries as nobody knows what it holds in store for them! Some miscalculations, misjudgments will be made because everything is new, you are encountering them for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People you’ll meet will tell you things you’ve not heard before. They’ll ask questions you’ve not thought about; all combined will put stress on your mind as you listen trying to make sense of whatever you hear! The questions will task your mind to think.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every encounter, every experience is new! Even if you think it is a routine it is always new because there is always an addition to what existed yesterday&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A day is indeed a journey, you have never walked through it before. It is for this reason that you must begin each day well prepared spiritually, mentally and emotionally. For you don’t know the challenges, trials, temptations etc. that may come your way.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Focus therefore on the day in hand and not that of tomorrow, take each day ( journey) seriously. I am persuaded to believe that this is what Jesus meant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 6:34&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[34] Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore enjoy today’s “ journey “ as I write this it’s seven (7) am, my plane just landed and I am getting ready to step out of it. I am yet to meet a welcoming party to say good morning!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy the beauty of the day, have fun do not over stress yourself. Admire everything! It is a journey enjoy the trip, soon departure time ( night) will come and announcements will be made asking you to board your flight back to bed!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts to share, each day is indeed a mystery. You’ve never walked through it before. May God grant you the wisdom to go through the journey of today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Adversity Seen Through A Positive Eye</p><p>Psalms 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bold and a courageous affirmation you’ve just read from a man who&nbsp; turned adversity into an advantage, impossible to possible, tears to joy, poverty to riches, dishonor to honor, grass to grace, Yes this is David, reflecting on his experiences&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike many, David saw the positive side of every adversity that befell Him. To him, anything that happened has a positive value or lessons to teach him. This is what he meant when he said&nbsp;</p><p>“Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the rod and staff describe the two ends of the same stick a shepherd carries.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two ends of the shepherd’s “ stick “ are not the same both in shape and usage. One end is straight the other curved. One end is used to guide ( the straight end)&nbsp; the other ( the curved) is used to punish. There are times when both ends are used simultaneously to punish.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Adversity, tragedy, mishap, misfortune etc contrary to what the majority thinks, are God’s ways to redirect us. David knew this from experience hence what he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved many of us will say the same regarding things that have happened to us, by which means we are who and what we are today. I discovered my gift of writing when I left the pulpit. Instead of lamenting the Holy Spirit directed me to the pen!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Words either spoken or written are weapons that no one can stop! The pen is mightier than the sword. Through writing, I have probably preached almost half of the sermons I’ve preached orally though the audience may be small I’ve reached many than I would have if I were glued to one place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What about people with physical disabilities? Take a look at the great things most of them have done. Yes, physical disability is not mental or intellectual disability! It is God’s way of directing their destinies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, God uses adversities to redirect our destinies. This is the beauty of adversity and this is how it should be seen. Ever heard the saying “ when sea dry we go by land ?” Adversities should not stop us, they are meant to redirect, refocus, and reset so we can climb up to higher grounds in life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is this not what James meant when He said;&nbsp;</p><p>James 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; 3+ Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4+ But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This situation is truly difficult to understand if one is not wise and this is why James added the following verse; read it&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So now, you see why James mentioned wisdom? Pay attention to the context. It is a prescription To see and turn adversity into an advantage you’ll need wisdom! Which is true and it is only the wise who see adversity as an opportunity!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All that I’ve said so far is not to downplay the negative effects and or the consequences of adversities. No on the contrary I acknowledge that they can and are very devastating.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, they are the Divine means by which our destinies are redirected. So wake up, wipe the tears, stop complaining, look beyond them, see (visualise) the glory and the goodness that lies ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With God all things are possible and with Christ, you are more than a conqueror! This is how many have turned adversities into advantages! You can also do the same.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Adversities Re-position Us”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Treasure What You’ve Found! &nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Matthew 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:</p><p>46+ Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a society where the majority settles for anything this merchant is presented to us as a man of different character.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of settling for anything, he chose to first investigate before making a move.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the context as we read, the statement is about the “kingdom of heaven”, which “kingdom” is represented on earth by the church of Christ!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lesson is don’t settle for anything ( church) until you’ve investigated its quality, and by extension take time to study before you join any religious group.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Apply the same spirit of curiosity to almost everything. Is it business, friendship, social club, marriage etc; take time to examine everything! Many have joined groups, churches, social clubs, marriages etc only to regret. Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of the church, many had to move from one church group to another before finally settling down with the church that is mentioned and described in the New Testament! Like the merchant, they were equally looking for a pearl of great value in terms of biblical truth/teaching and practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second lesson from the action of this merchant is that he “gave up to give in ”when he found the best. One word describes what he did: commitment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was influenced by the phrase I’ve often used, <i>“ Decision determines destiny “</i>. It was a critical step, choice and decision he made.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of commitment has been identified as a major factor in the failure of many an enterprise be it religious, social or economic! Commitment is the ingredient that brings to life dreams and aspirations!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve heard the saying <i>“ if wishes were horses, beggars would ride to hell” </i>! Yes, it is our commitment that translates dreams into reality, or else they remain wishes. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there are many on the periphery of life, many with their heads full of dreams and wishes, but what they lack is the initial spark and commitment to turn that spark into a flame!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve given up all you had to get whatever you now have, then be committed to it else your loss will be devastating! Give heed to the Apostle John’s exhortation ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 John 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a lighter note, we were blessed and privileged to locate this Merchant and asked him how he felt after giving up all to get what he got; he asked instead to sing a song as his answer! And here is what he sang,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>I have decided to follow</i></p><p><i>Jesus, no turning back,&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>No turning back!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Cross before me</i></p><p><i>The world behind me&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>No turning back&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>No turning&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Though none will</i></p><p><i>Go with me,</i></p><p><i>Still, I will follow&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>No turning back “</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We walked away believing that we had met a mentor, a great example of what it means “ decision determining a destiny.!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</p><p>25+ Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I wish I were a painter, this is one picture I’ll paint and hang on my wall to remind me of the need to be cautious. Can you imagine this happening to the great Apostle Paul?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Someone who stood before Felix and Agrippa, and several others spoke powerfully without fear or intimidation. Yes!&nbsp; Yet here is he being put in a large-sized laundry basket! Carried, towed or dragged on the floor pushed through an opening in a wall.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not only this, there was another threat to his life which was revealed to him by his nephew!

Read his account ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Kings 19</p><p>KJV</p><p>2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.</p><p>3+ And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and came to Beer–sheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4+ But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was shortly after the local newspapers and social media have published the events that took place on Mount Carmel. Everyone was expecting to see the hero of the day, so the streets were lined up expecting Elijah. Only to be told he has fled!&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, even the strongest of the strong is also human, the blood that flows through our veins is the same that flows through his.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Both Elijah and Paul took measures to protect themselves. Even Jesus did the same as recorded read it ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>John 7</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It would be foolhardy if the three mentioned ignored the threats to their lives. Even so, it would be foolhardy today if any should ignore threats to their life all in the name of “ God will protect me”. Is God unable to protect Paul, He can but Paul agreed to the advice and suggestion to be put in a basket!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are always physical,&nbsp; spiritual ( or both) threats to our lives, from both known and unknown sources, ignore these at the peril of your life. Even friends we eat and socialize with can become security threats.&nbsp;</p><p>.</p><p>Did the Lord not acknowledge this? He did hear him;&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 10</p><blockquote><p>KJV</p><p>36+ And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And also the psalmist, read what he wrote from experience,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalm 55:12-14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] If an enemy were insulting me, I could endure it; if a foe were rising against me, I could hide.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[13] But it is you, a man like myself, my companion, my close friend, [14] with whom I once enjoyed sweet fellowship at the house of God, as we walked about among the worshipers.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, threats ( physical or spiritual) to our lives are real do not underestimate or downplay any. Paul took his seriously, Jesus did the same and so was Elijah. It would be foolhardy to ignore.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Watch and pray He said. He did not say we close our eyes and pray. It is like saying to us; listen around, pay attention to developments around you. Watch the movements around you. Discern actions even words that are spoken reveal threats so think through whatever you hear.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every man of value and importance to God /society /family/workplace etc is a target if you are one of these then do not let your guard down! Watch and pray listen to and take advice</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul did and was delivered learn to do the same. You are of value and importance to us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share; a word to the wise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The reason(s) for these form the basis of this article.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many have accused me of forgetting their birthdays, marriage anniversaries, outdooring, and other such ceremonies and they are right in doing so. I’ve always pleaded guilty and offered sincere apologies.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But why is it so, is a question I set out to find out and here is what I discovered!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anything that does not occur daily, any item that I don’t use daily, falls under this category. Birthdays don’t occur every day, marriage anniversaries do not occur every day so the possibility of me forgetting them is high. You can make a list of things that do not occur daily in your life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, there are two most important things that can be so embarrassing in life if forgotten! You may ask what these are? I’d love to leave it to you to find out but for the sake of time, I’d like to help!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are passwords and scriptures! These two if not used regularly can be forgotten with dire consequences!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine standing in front of an ATM Machine on a cashless day trying to withdraw money for the weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine trying to open your laptop or tablet and being requested to input your password because it has been a long time since you used it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What about the scriptures?</p><p>Imagine being confronted with a spiritual challenge, and you open the Bible to read a verse that will comfort and help you pray, only to discover you’ve forgotten the book, chapter and verse where to find the verse.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine being engaged with someone in a discussion in which you have proven publicly that the other party is in the wrong, and he demands to know the passage of scripture that forms the basis of your conclusions. You took the Bible flipped through but could not locate the verse.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dearly beloved, like passwords, the bible if not regularly studied or read the tendency to forget its contents are very high. So to avoid this use your passwords regularly and read the Bible daily</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The majority have put their passwords as it were on “autopilot”, once signed in they never revisit it again. These do argue “ oh I don’t have time to be retyping “&nbsp; &nbsp;It is when the equipment crashes or gets corrupted that is when they see the importance of typing in the password regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the way many have put their lives ( mind, brains!) on “ autopilot “ they are not learning anything new. They are content and satisfied with what they knew several years ago! It is these who resist change everywhere hence the lack of development and growth wherever they find themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you care to know “ autopilot” is a lazy way of living, a lazy way to lead people or institutions as it lacks growth and dynamism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid forgetting things in life, adopt a sign-in-each-day approach, the constant and regular use of anything helps retain knowledge and wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me conclude with these wise words of comparison by the Hebrew writer&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Hebrews 5:12,14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food! [14] But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The operative words are “ constant use”. Use your passwords regularly just as you'll read the bible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The goal is equality,</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul on his fundraising campaign for the brethren in Judaea made this his central theme, the interdependency of the church.&nbsp; He told the brethren at Corinth a well-endowed city of the need to assist the needy brethren in Judaea.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His argument is simple, no condition is permanent; today it is them (sic) tomorrow it will be you. The unfortunate truth is this exhortation has been forgotten, and has been replaced by the majority with selfishness!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of cooperating with each we are rather in competition with one another. Instead of sharing we are hoarding our blessings. Each wants to outshine the other.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proverbial “scratch my back so I scratch your back” though this has been used in the negative and derogatory sense; is what Paul’s appeal seems to suggest. Scratch my back today so I scratch yours tomorrow!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though we see around us the truth of this statement yet we are unable to embrace and apply it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mutual dependence is a natural law, every creation of God depends on each other to survive. Plants, animals and humans depend on nature’s provisions. Each provides support to the other. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That we need each other to survive is an undeniable truth. To avoid loneliness we make friends to provide us with fellowship! To help us improve our lives we engage the services of teachers or mentors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“No man is an island” is a poem written by John Donne, in which he stressed the interconnectivity of humanity.

Some did, others failed. I was one of those who failed to comply!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was the era the Ayigbe carpenters ( Efo) introduced to the Ghanaian market the small wooden savings boxes. Yes, &nbsp;(Ayigbe Carpenters) to them belong the patent no one can deny that!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then came adulthood, and we had financial experts demonstrating to us financial plans that can make us financially sound and stable if we apply them. Many did, others failed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge of pursuing present gratification as against deferral has worried every youth, to this day it is still the number one hurdle to overcome. Interestingly, the Bible recommended long ago the deferral approach as the way to future joy and happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 13:12&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, gratification ( hope) deferred surely makes the heart sick, your friends are enjoying and you’ll love to do the same but choose not to because you want to invest for tomorrow!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is not how you start but how you end. You can have a good start but end up miserably. You can have a slow start but end up a winner. What passage of scripture does this bring to mind?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 9</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, exactly!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I must admit as a youth the thought of postponing gratification was a great challenge! What if “ tomorrow “ never comes to meet you ? This is the question that keeps popping up! When is the future?&nbsp;</p><p>We hear it said every day, but when is it?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, every day was once a future. Today was referred to yesterday as a future just as tomorrow is called a future today. Every day therefore is a future come real so do not think of a future as if it were a distant time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since man must live as is usually said what then must we do with regards to postponing today’s enjoyment to tomorrow? Must it be all or some? Here is a recommendation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>“ All work and no play made Oko an anti-social moron!&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a principle called “selective deferment”, by which is meant there are things that can and must of necessity be deferred whereas others can be enjoyed. What these are depends on your choices and goals in life! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, you can defer early “marriage” to pursue the&nbsp; &nbsp;academic/training/apprenticeship etc, the same applies to entertainment here moderation is the word.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Make friends, associate with groups etc. but “abhor” certain groupings so you do not come into conflict with the law Always remember what scripture said;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 1:10-11,13-15&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[10] My son, if sinful men entice you, do not give in to them. [11] If they say, “Come along with us; let's lie in wait for innocent blood, let's ambush some harmless soul;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[13] we will get all sorts of valuable things and fill our houses with plunder; [14] cast lots with us; we will all share the loot ”--- [15] my son, do not go along with them, do not set foot on their paths;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So what is all this about? Defer ( postpone) the present for the future &nbsp; Deny yourself the present to enjoy the future. Yes, it will hurt, but that is the only way. to a better future. Use the present to lay a strong foundation for tomorrow&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However you define the future, it will surely come. Remember today was yesterday‘s future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A complex thought to share!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This is what should be in the church. Whereas civil society points to a constitution as the basis of determining right or wrong, the church points to the scriptures (the Bible).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If something is right or wrong by scripture, and it is so established and grounded in unambiguous terms; then that is what it is nothing can be done to make a right wrong or vice versa. Scriptures have spoken.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But where there is no such stated rule(s) we are left to fashion out our own rules however these must not be rigidly imposed or enforced. Acceptance and compliance are voluntary choices to the extent that each person sees them as they are.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We do this because there is no law, and where there is no law there is no sin. For it is through the law that we come to know what is sin. Sin is not defined by man, sin is not what man says it is, but what the scriptures say.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is in this context that the above scriptures must be understood,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Romans 14:14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[14] I am convinced, being fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for that person it is unclean.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As can be seen from the discussion, the controversy that Paul was addressing is the eating of meat, herbs etc.&nbsp; It looks like the contention was between vegetarians and non-vegetarians.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The issue was about liberty, Do Christians have liberty? Do we have any freedoms? This is a question nobody is asking! To most Christians there is nothing like liberty all is about the rule of law and the strict obedience without which you are not a Christian.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul’s statement “&nbsp; that nothing is unclean in itself.” Has to do with anything that the Scriptures have said nothing about. Surely, there are things that scriptures have designated as clean and unclean so if care is not taken to understand what Paul meant by putting this expression in context, we shall be making scripture to contradict itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a question of Christian liberty when it comes to things that are not mentioned and also in the absence of rules, or any thus saith the Lord; &nbsp; In such situations what should we do? &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is where we have the problem, whereas some would prefer not to do anything though there is no law, some think otherwise. So the conflict or controversy is between those who prefer to do nothing and those who prefer to do something!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By Paul’s logic, those who prefer to do nothing have not done anything wrong it is their choice. Likewise, those who prefer to do something have also not done any wrong except that they should take into account the feelings of the other group!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom line is that neither of these two groups has sinned. For where there is no law, there is no sin. To do or not to do anything where there is no law is a matter of the individual's choice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is important is that no one puts a stumbling block in the path of the other. Because each shall render account.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p><p>13+ Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our problem is one of knowing, acknowledging and understanding that ;&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Not everything is stated in black and white in the scriptures&nbsp;</li><li>There is something called Christian liberty&nbsp;</li><li>The practice of which is a matter of choice and not a force, it is voluntary&nbsp;</li><li>This liberty is practiced in matters that have nothing to do with salvation&nbsp;</li><li>In the practice of Christian liberty, each must be considerate and mindful of their actions, it’s impact on others.

Amen.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wow, you’ll say but it is true. The Apostle John attempted to pen down as it were a biography of Jesus, along the way he realized how daunting such a task would be. Hence the conclusive statements you’ve just read.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These verses came to mind when I was tasked to write a biography of a loved one who lived up to a ripe old age ( age withheld for ethical reasons). I applied all the research skills I was taught in school but I found that one story leads to another. In the end, I had to give up and sum up in a few paragraphs the “life and times “ of Mr X.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What I learnt is this, the true entire biography of everyone can not be written on earth. I’ve been to funerals where brochures numbered several pages but still, they could not capture the entirety of the dead!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was confirmed by listening to as many as were at the funeral; each has a story to tell, an incident to describe, an admonition to recall. Yes!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our true biography can not be written here, it can only be written in Heaven. What we have written here are edited versions, some parts are removed, rephrased, rewritten etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can you imagine reading a biography of someone who lived up to a hundred in a little under ten or fifteen minutes? Yes, that is what you hear at funerals. Edited version.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, we are looking forward to that of Heaven where there will be no editing, it will be read as it is.&nbsp; That is what I’ll love to hear. The heavenly one has no lies, encomiums, exaggerations, garnishing etc. It does not aim at making a fool look wise, a wicked look good, a selfish look selfless&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yes! That day will be that day.! As Paul put it;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Corinthians 4:5&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[5] Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So beloved, worry not about what your biography would be or look like, that of the earth is edited, rephrased, and efforts will be made to paint you a saint or an angel when they know full well that is not the case!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A man known in his area as a no-nonsense husband; who often beat his wife, didn’t make her a top agenda but at his funeral; mourners were thrilled to hear what she wrote about him. , She wrote, “ he was a sweet loving man, he cared and provided for us OH! Hmmm, I miss him forever “! Yes you’ve heard this several times&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On one occasion I dared to ask why it is so? I was told that traditionally you don’t speak evil of the dead! Why? I received no answer! Will he come back to haunt you? Will he kill you? No one could answer. It's all a taboo design to let as it were “sleeping dogs lie” &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A dead person whether good or bad must be praised and be well spoken of! Yes. But not so in Heaven there a spade shall be called a spade. If in doubt just take any bible character of repute and read everything about him and you’ll know what heaven’s biography will look like!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a question of biography and tributes, no matter how lengthy or short they are, the true one shall be both written and read in Heaven. The reading may take much longer than what pertains here. Prepare for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is so much good about you that is not known, that Day will reveal them. Those who choose deliberately not to know or acknowledge you will hear it read by not a human being but an Angel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The reading shall be interrupted intermittently by the sound of trumpets blown by Angels! After which a white robe shall be put over you, and you’ll majestically be led to take your seat by the Throne.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, what a glorious day awaits you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p><strong>Faith Moves Mountains; Wisdom Protects And Guides. Be A Patriot&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 9:14-15&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[14] There was once a small city with only a few people in it. And a powerful king came against it, surrounded it and built huge siege works against it. [15] Now there lived in that city a man poor but wise, and he saved the city by his wisdom. But nobody remembered that poor man.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up I heard much said concerning patriotism and how we should love and serve our country. During the Young Pioneer Movement days of Nkrumah, we the members of were taught this virtue -to love and serve the nation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A pledge was composed which was recited at every meeting of the Movement. Later over time, the Young Pioneer Movement spread to include schools and every child became a member. It first began with a select few.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A part of what we recited at our parades called the Code reads, “protection of state property, reliability and secrecy, comradeship and forbearance “ etc. It starts with the words “ I solemnly pledge to be faithful and loyal to the ideas ( ideals)&nbsp; of the founder of the nation, Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah etc. etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, patriotism was woven into our moral conscience from the Word go, but for the coup of 1966, Ghana would have been a haven of patriots. Nation-building was the goal, and it was nearly achieved.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The above scriptures talk about an incident that according to Solomon was amazing, a city was saved by the wisdom of a poor man. A patriot you may call him. According to “ Uncle “ Solo he learnt two lessons that he will never forget, that is; the value and place of wisdom and patriotism, regardless of one’s economic status.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The city which was under siege was delivered through the wise advice this poor man gave. Something he did out of love for the city. Though we are not told what he said at least we know he was a man armed with ideas, know how etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hear Solomon;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 9:16&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] So I said, “Wisdom is better than strength.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These words seem to suggest that at the Town Hall meeting convened to discuss what to do; the majority were of the view that a “ boot for boot “ approach should be used.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the wise poor man got up to speak, he was likely heckled by the rich majority &nbsp; This can be gleaned from what Solomon said; Read it&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ecclesiastes 9:17</p><p>NIV</p><p>[17] The quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a subtle way of saying that whereas “ the majority of rich fools” were screaming their naïve solutions, the poor man spoke his wisdom in a low tone!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you not seen or experienced this before? Surely you have. Meetings where “ empty barrels” get up to scream incoherent, naïve etc ideas wanting to be heard just because they have a few socio/economic advantages!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom has nothing to do with what you wear, how you appear, the car you drive, the food you eat, the house you own, or the bed you sleep on. It has got to do with the quality of the contents of your head-brain!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Your ability to think quality thoughts. Your ability to provide quality solutions to challenges, your ability to see what others can not see. Your ability to make sense of nonsense! Need I add more?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom is distilled knowledge, knowledge taken through the refinery of life. Tested and devoid of ambiguities and impurities of hazy, crooked thinking. Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wisdom does not belong to the rich nor the poor, it is not the monopoly of a group. Wisdom is wisdom whoever desires it receives it. It is a gift.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>James 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>5+ If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The man in question was not wise because he was poor!&nbsp;</p><p>Poverty is a condition, a state, an economic and not a mental/intellectual deprivation! It is reversible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just as knowledge comes from books, so does wisdom come from God, every endowment has a source. There is divine wisdom and there is the secular they both have a part to play in human endeavours and are therefore necessary. Blessed is the man who possesses both, for he shall do wonders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because wisdom comes from God, He gives it to whomsoever He chooses, young or old, illiterate or literate, poor or rich, believer or non-believer etc; per what He wants accomplished!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Faith moves mountains, wisdom guides and protects we need both to be patriotic citizens of the kingdom of God, the Church of the Living&nbsp; God!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p><strong>Choices And What Influences Them: The Case Of A Selfless Person.&nbsp;</strong></p><blockquote><p>Philippians 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better: 24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life is filled with choices, decisions, consequences etc, each day or hour we are called upon to make a choice or a decision. Some of which may conflict with what we wish for ourselves but for the sake of others we act in ways that will inure to their good.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is it that influences such decisions and how do we call persons who make such choices?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul found himself in one such situation which is what you’ve read above. He opted for that which will inure to the good of his followers. This is the hallmark of a selfless person.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A selfless person is among other things is someone who puts others’ interests, convenience, etc above his own. Read the following as examples;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Say I have a bottle of water to drink but seeing that you are thirstier than l am, I choose to offer you the water. Not because I am not thirsty, you saw that I am.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again I had GHC 5,000 to use in settling a debt which is due in two weeks, it is a mandatory payment l must honour; yet you approached me with an urgent request. Your child is in admission and needs a life-saving medication.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have a debt to settle failure of which will bring me public disgrace as my name will be blacklisted and published in the dailies. Yet I gave the money to you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the hallmark of a selfless person. Someone willing to endure humiliation to save a life! Do you know that is what Jesus meant in practical&nbsp; terms the oft-quoted scripture&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>John 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us look at the scenarios I painted in the examples above to see how they respond to Jesus’ statement!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Water is life any reduction in the level in our bodies is called dehydration which poses a threat to life if not corrected early. So in giving away my water, I laid down my life for my friend who received and drank it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Doesn’t this answer to Jesus’ statement?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Scenario two, I gave out money I should have used to settle a mandatory debt, consequences of which are public disgrace and humiliation&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, but I did this to save a life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now you know what it means to be selfless. If we make a choice that ends up in helping someone out of a predicament at a cost to us, this makes us selfless and pleases God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved this is not something you and I cannot do; some do it almost every day! You are one, if you care to know the last time you offered me a lift even though you were not going my direction.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The last time you made me that tea using the last milk and teabag which you were going to use for yourself. ( This reminds me of the widow of Zarephath )&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The last time you saw me off with money you had intended to use for a pressing need, to buy fuel to take me home. Hardly did you know that you were laying down your life for my good.!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In doing these you are fulfilling what both Jesus and john said. Read that of John</p><blockquote><p>1 John 3:16&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>( You read my article titled “ I want to know what love is!)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To Paul, this is what it means to walk in love. ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Ephesians 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If Jesus did these for our sakes, we also ought to do the same to ourselves ;</p><blockquote><p>John 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet.</p></blockquote><p><br>Be selfless, in making choices, factor in how the choice will inure to the good of others. There is so much selfishness parading as success in our midst. This is very subtle and is not easily discerned.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A word to the wise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers,</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Matthew 7</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the “christo-religious” foundation in Ghana is shaking under the weight of diviner’s and sorcerers parading as apostle’s and prophets to whom almost everyone educated or uneducated, politician or electorate, rich or poor, etc are turning to for succour.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most sought-after personalities today are Diviners (predictors/forecasters). People who can look into the future and predict gloom and doom, because good news does not attract it is the bad, so if you can predict gloom and doom then you are in business! Fear is the key factor!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A wave of change is blowing through the nation. True faith has come under threat, many are wavering, unsure of which is which, the country is at the crossroads. Developments are scary and extreme fear has gripped the populace&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The passages listed above speak volumes about the challenges faced by the early Christians. Diviners and sorcerers were present as they are today. The early believers were warned and told to expect these developments ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2 Peter 2:1, 3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them-bringing swift destruction on themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[3] In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today majority are unable to identify divination and sorcery, as it was in the past so it is today many mistake it to be the power of God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The girl with the spirit of divination that Paul rebuked was not saying anything wrong. She was telling the truth&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Hear her;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Acts 16:16-17</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] Once when we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future. She earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune-telling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[17] She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way to be saved.”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read this? “We were met by a female slave who had a spirit by which she predicted the future”?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The KJV reads,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Acts 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two words worth noting: “divination and soothsaying “ &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The spirit of “ divination” enables the possessor to “ predict the future “Do you now understand what is meant by divination? There is a spirit which, when you possess you can predict the future. That is what we are reading from this verse!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The practice of Divination, involves the practitioner entering and peeping into the spiritual realm! A practice God forbade the Jews from engaging in. Divination and sorcery were part of a package that included other practices they were forbidden to practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Leviticus 20</p><p>KJV</p><p>6+ And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Deuteronomy 18:9-12&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[9] When you enter the land the Lord your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there</p><p>. [10] Let no one be found among you who sacrifices their son or daughter in the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft,&nbsp;</p><p>[11] or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. [12] Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord; because of these same detestable practices, the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether we believe it or not, there is a spiritual realm where invincible forces war against each other. It is a battle between good and evil. It is not a movie but a reality. Jesus knew this, and Paul was aware. Did he not say the following? Read a few ;&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 10</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds ;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At a point in His ministry, Jesus interceded for Peter when Satan planned for his downfall, read it&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 22</p><p>KJV</p><p>31+ And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p><p>32 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The invincible unseen Hand of God surrounds us as such the evil hosts of Satan are unable to penetrate! We in leadership are his target, he will use every means possible, every little opening etc to derail our forward march! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, some church members are ready-made, willing tools in his hand to be used in executing his diabolical plans!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some spiritual hosts are arrayed against us, but at the same time, there are friendly hosts fighting on our behalf as Jesus did for Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is into this realm that diviners and sorcerers tap through satanic means to either alter, falsify, turn /change destinies etc. One such incident was what Jesus saw about Peter and aborted it. Satan was going to change his destiny!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is exactly what we see unfolding before our very eyes. People’s destinies are being changed and aborted in the spiritual realms! Unnatural phenomena are occurring because the arrangements in the spiritual realms have been infiltrated and tampered with!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Divination and sorcery are real! They are not imaginary or theoretical concepts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you recall this incident?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>1 Samuel 28</p><p>KJV</p><p>11 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? For thou art Saul.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>13 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>14+ And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>15 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some have doubted and denied this incident because they lack knowledge of the dark world. Unfortunately, these are those who fall prey to diviners because they lack knowledge regarding the practice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spiritism, divination, soothsaying etc are real. There is the temptation to deny but they are real. We are forbidden to dabble in any of these practices&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Deuteronomy 29:29&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[29] The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may follow all the words of this law.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This scripture acknowledges that there are “ secret things “ but they belong to God. He placed an embargo on His servants not to venture into such realms to look for etc anything He has “ classified “ which the writer referred to as “ secret “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same scripture also leaves in the Hands of God the right to “ declassify “ and whatever He “declassifies “ we will put it into the public domain. Whatever He declassifies is no secret!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if any claims to be a servant of God and yet ventures into such “secret realms “ when Hw has forbidden any to enter, then he is not a true servant of God, He is a disobedient servant, a fake or an imposter because he has disobeyed His directives&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a need for prayers and discernment, for the times are dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These may say “ God has revealed this or that to me” which is not true. What he claims is something he saw when he peeped into the secret forbidden realms!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed we are at a crossroads! Like Elymas some of these diviners/sorcerers sit at high places with rulers ( politicians ) &nbsp; &nbsp;They’ve made the rulers ( politicians ) to believe and endorse them as powerful men!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ghana is not a theocracy (spiritual) but a democracy (secular) both have different forms of governance structures and constitutions! These must be respected by the two institutions ( church and state ) and their operatives ( ministers and politicians )&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately for us, there is a drift by the operatives of the spiritual towards the secular, for whatever reasons your guess is as good as mine. Limelight, political favour and privileges!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are dangerous times, diviners and sorcerers are taking over true faith and practice, and by extension political governance as they seek to influence rulers and men in authority&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved as the psalmist of old requested so do I today ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Psalm 122:6-7&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[6] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you be secure. [7] May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels. ”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Victory Through Perseverance&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>27+ And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</p><p>28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was amazed by this response from the Canaanite mother who came to plead on behalf of her daughter who was experiencing some spiritual challenges.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus wanted to test her faith by saying what may be regarded today as an unpleasant comment. Read it.&nbsp;</p><p>22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p><p>24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>25+ Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p><p>26+ But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read this?</p><p>Matthew 15:26&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[26] He replied, “It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dogs? Just because I’ve come to seek help? Oh no!!&nbsp; Surely this is enough to put away anyone making a plea or a request, as it sounds offensive but not this woman.!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read her response&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 15:27&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[27] “Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master's table.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She did not doubt what Jesus said but she also gave a profound response, a response that touched the heart of Jesus. She said, “ master, with all due respect in case you’ve forgotten, let me remind you, even the crumbs that fall from the table are delicacies to dogs!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Please note, she said these while smiling! Not in a combatant disrespectful manner!)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this saying of her’s Jesus had no option but to yield to her request. He understood and interpreted her response as an expression of faith. Read it;</p><p>Matthew 15:28&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[28] Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is victory through perseverance! This woman instead of walking away stood her ground, regardless of how provocative Jesus’ answer to her was, she stood her ground!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, regardless of what the negatives are or may be; stand your ground until your request is granted. See these negatives as a test of your &nbsp;resolve.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was young and TV sets were not very common, so we often trooped to watch one in a house where we were not entertained! Our parents could not afford one so we were treated as outcasts!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At six pm every evening we would go to watch Bonanza,(?) featuring Dan Blocker, Pernell Roberts and also The Saint etc. &nbsp;We would be accused of not taking our baths therefore we are smelling! &nbsp;We were not allowed to cross a demarcated zone even though the TV set was placed outside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes. All manner of insults would be rained on us, with strict restrictions among which is not to talk, laugh or shout! Reader, who watches an exciting film without engaging in any of these? But these were the rules. The intent was to make things intolerable so we quit!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like the woman mentioned above, we stood our ground regardless of the provocations and insults because we wanted to enjoy ourselves! We were focused, we defied all odds to remain and watch the TV. We never walked away.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Poverty teaches lessons, &nbsp;one such lesson is perseverance. This we learnt from our youth due to the circumstances we found ourselves in. Little did we know we were preparing ourselves to face the challenges in life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear reader, regardless of provocations, no matter the unpleasant comments, ‘go and comes’ (sic) that may be thrown in your path; persevere for they are the trials of your faith and patience.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do not walk away from the prize before you because of insults, stand your ground and victory will be yours. Always remember, “no thorns no crown! “If you can wear the crown of thorns, you’ll have no difficulty wearing that of gold!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Paul said ;&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we must go through hazards to win a victory, this is a principle of life we can not escape but must experience. The Canaanite woman walked away after receiving a commendation from Jesus. “ Great is Thy Faith !”&nbsp; This can also be said of you, Great is your perseverance!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

As it is with the good, so with the sinful; as it is with those who take oaths, so with those who are afraid to take them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though we differ in many respects, pursue different ideals and goals in life one thing is common to us all, death.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No matter what are status’ is in life we have one thing in common; death, as was said to Adam our great-grandfather; “ from the dust you were taken and to dust shall thou return “.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This we see every day as we visit the cemetery where coffins containing the mortal remains of people who once lived, ate, laughed, etc with lowered into a pit dug for them and covered with soil and in a split moment vanish from our sight for good!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As has also been said, these take nothing they possessed away; “ we brought nothing into the world and we shall certainly take nothing away “. Nothing In, Nothing Out!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything we own here is on a rental basis, they don’t belong to us, even our bodies are rented properties! At the appropriate time when our tenancy runs out the owner takes His properties back.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone entering the world at birth signed a tenancy agreement, interestingly this agreement is not physical but spiritual.

One thing is clear, He does not abrogate the contract/tenancy, He allows it to run its full course! Any abrogation is not His but man-initiated. So be careful you don’t initiate any process that will abrogate your tenancy agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again we the tenants can not Influence Him.

When, we don’t know this weekend we are seeing many off since their tenancies have expired!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us be wise with how we live, we are living on borrowed time so every second matters!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It varies from person to person, but simply it is any permanent inconvenience that puts limitations on enjoying your total freedom!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many have certain limitations that they’ve worried themselves about, they’ve spent so much fortune to have them removed but to no avail.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are not alone, Paul was like that. Three times he petitioned God, but to no avail. However, unlike us, he resolved and resigned his will to God. Read what he wrote,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p><p>9+ And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. “Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities”, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, accept your “ cross “ live with it and enjoy life. Your worries will not change anything! I have a metal implant in my right arm, and it’s been there since 1989! Truly a “ thorn in my flesh” there is nothing I can do about &nbsp;it but to live with it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My grace is sufficient for thee was not said only to Paul, but by extension also to us who are in situations similar to his.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore beloved, avoid self-pity. Look at the positive side of life and enjoy yourself regardless! God will provide strength to help us bear our Crosses! He did it to Paul and will do it to us who trust Him&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take&nbsp;</p>",

These are those who are quick to send condolences but will not show up at any of the above events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is only the “ family and empathisers” who stay through all the stages mentioned above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now you’ve seen the error contained in the template!

Yet we can not say it in the open but only in private! Basically to avoid “ trouble !”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what is it that made them “ foolish?”! The context provides the answer! Read it; to learn and avoid such mistakes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you see? They did not plan. They did not think it through. They did not anticipate! They did not project.! They did not envisage! It was these that conferred on them the unfortunate title /description “ foolish!”!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Am sure after reading these some names/friends etc came to mind! You know some just as I also do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this category are found people with weak minds, people who accept /believe etc things on face value. People who follow some for the sake of it! People who put their trust explicitly in others without thinking for themselves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In Marxist terminology, they are called the “ lumpen-proletariat “. The working class that places its absolute trust in its leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’ve ever read George Orwell’s novel “ The Animal Farm” you’ll come across a horse called “ Boxer”!&nbsp; Yes! He worked tirelessly because he believed in&nbsp; Napoleon and the rest as always being right. Only to be disappointed in the end!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today we have the same in our fellowship, secular (political)&nbsp; or divine ( church ) where some place absolute trust in leadership! Forgetting that they are also human, flesh and blood.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our case, some do this to gain favour, to be in the good books of leaders, what we would call blind followership for selfish interests' sake. Even though they see and know what is wrong they’ll not speak out!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are not only “ foolish “ but also “hypocritical”. Wherever they outnumber the wise you can be sure of failure in that setup be it secular or divine.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not only does the description /tile “foolish” fit the weak-minded followers, but equally fits some in leadership! Yes. These are those who play politics with the Truth by turning a blind eye to the truth! Unfortunately, there are many!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like secular leadership, these love/crave the support offered by the weak-minded in society or church; the human “Boxers ” Of the Animal Farm drama of George Orwell! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After serving in the ministry for over half a century I have seen these unfortunate developments at work! Wherever you turn to in life, there will always be the “ five were wise and five were foolish “!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the “foolish” we shall have with us always.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My revisit to the parable, lessons I learnt these I share with you!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

That was Accra then, areas such as Adabraka, Osu were our targets!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We go out with the mindset that our collective strengths will work wonders for us, and it did in most cases except for a few.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same mindset, the collective will; is what the above scriptures are teaching us, that whatever we wish, if we pool our spiritual strengths we shall record success because it receives Divine approval.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is where we’ve failed as a people. The foundational theology teaches that this was said to the apostles and since we are not it does not apply in our time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we are not “apostles “ but the “principle” remains the same. Pool individual spiritual resources together and you attain results as it will certainly receive Divine approval.

Our prayers are nothing but “ ma tra makwèî”. “Try and see,” it is not based on faith.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well as Jesus said, “ as your faith is so be it unto you !”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is spiritual strength and power in the collective. Whatever they bind is bound, whatever they loosen is loosed.

Ask ( pray) with certainty “ believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them!”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, what a privilege we’ve forfeited!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We must encourage collective prayer sessions since this is the way we can pool spiritual power to bind and loosen anything, this shall receive divine approval!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

If someone you call a friend treats you casually, know that he/she never looked for you. He/she does not desire you as a friend. To him, you are an acquaintance and not a friend.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is nothing wrong with being an acquaintance, it is a relationship; just that it is a low-level relationship.&nbsp; And take note, low-level relationships come with low-level commitments!

They are seen as the pillars of the Movement and discussing this incident may do damage to the high esteem in which they are held.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though we all agree that it was recorded to teach us, we are simply afraid of examining it. In my view, we can discuss it from the objective point of view. Each of the two men had reasons for splitting from the other.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take a look at the scenario ;</p><p>36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>37+ And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</p><p>38+ But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, they were united on the fact that there was the need to go revisit the brethren they had brought to the faith.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, the contention was about who should go with them, the Team! Barnabas felt that the Team should be made up of the original members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His reason(s) may be that these are men who already have some experience in mission work so they’ll not need to recruit and train as if they were new members. This could take time hence delaying the scheduled time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A cogent reason!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul would likely have agreed to this suggestion of Barnabas his fellow traveller. It was the mention and inclusion of John Mark, that triggered the conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul’s argument was, No he left and returned hence there is no need to take him along”. He further asked,” bro what is the guarantee that he will not repeat the same act?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite Barnabas’ assurances Paul stood his ground not yielding an inch. As a result, they parted company! Now let us look at the factors that could have influenced Paul’s decision&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He indeed argued from facts, John Mark left to return home. Barnabas on the other hand was of the view that he could be pardoned as a “ young man” who at the time was immature!”&nbsp; This is also a fact.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>5+ And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>13+ Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So in matters of fact, they both were correct; the other thing that influenced their decisions was “ emotion” and this was the main cause! Yes, emotion.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Factual decisions, that is decisions based on facts don’t divide, it is rather the emotional! And this is exactly what took place. Read it again;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 15:39 NIV</p><p>[39] They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company. Barnabas took Mark and sailed for Cyprus,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decisions made by both were influenced by their respective emotions! How do I know, you may ask? After many years when tension was down and tempers cooled, Paul asked for Mark to be brought to him! Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Timothy 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read this “ he is profitable to me for the ministry?” Paul’s Words.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isn’t it the same among us? Factual interpretation of scriptures does not divide us, it is our opinions ( emotional) about a verse /passage etc that divides us. Most uphold and defend their opinions despite the facts pointing to the contrary.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my line of duty, I’ve encountered many such conflicts. Whereas I argue and decide based on facts, others argue and decide based on emotional considerations of issues.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, they are able to sway many ( the emotionalists ) to believe in their emotional decisions only to regret. Both Paul and Barnabas parted company not on the facts but on emotional grounds.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anytime there is a conflict, when you trace the source you’ll come to one; emotional decisions were made. Wherever and whenever emotion and not reason are high, conflicts are bound to arise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And because emotions are difficult to control and bring down conflicts in whatever form ( wars, hostilities, quarrels, division ) etc continue&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What makes things worse is that to every emotion there is a name and a face called “ pride and shame”. It is these two that pose the challenge, they sustain and support emotional conflicts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is only one medication that cures them, it is called “ maturity “. I believe Paul and Barnabas took it hence Paul’s invitation to Mark to come and join him!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How do I know of Barnabas? Well, John Mark definitely would have to talk things over with his “uncle” Barnabas before accepting to join Paul.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Decisions based on facts don’t divide they unite. It is decisions based on emotions that divide because they fail to see reason!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is why “ in the midst of fools, it is foolishness to be wise !”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8+ And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some have asked, did Abraham lie to Isaac or did he know God would not let him down? Was he by this answer to Isaac expressing his absolute trust, confidence and faith in God? I leave you to answer for yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abraham was at the crossroads, the promised child had been born and not long he was asked to offer him as a sacrifice! It was a moment of mental agony and torment! But Abraham did not waver. Why?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us cross-examine him, what compelling evidence did he have hence he did what he did? What stands out is faith. But what is faith?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From this definition, we know that faith is not blind but is based on “ evidence “! But what evidence does Abraham have? To cut a long story short, he has walked with God since he left his hometown; and has experienced the hand of God in many ways so he knew the God he was dealing with!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He left his fate in the hands of God! Beloved, there comes a time in life when all you can do is to leave everything in the hands of God. At the crossroads in Gethsemane Jesus left his fate in the hands of God when he said&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 22</p><p>KJV</p><p>42+ Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There comes a time when humanely speaking you’ve exhausted every known answer, avenue, solution etc but still things remain the same. Like Abraham, like Jesus resign your will to God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like Abraham you’ve also walked with God for many years now, you’ve known at least how in your darkest hours He brought you “salvation” from nowhere. Trust Him to do it again.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abraham knew what God could do, hence the answer he gave to Isaac.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Genesis 22:8 NIV</p><p>[8] Abraham answered, “God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two of them went on together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you come to the crossroads, do not panic commit the situation or circumstance to God. Stand still and watch, you’ll see the hand of God moving to restore calm to your restless mind!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 26</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>3</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I write I am at a crossroad, I’ve done all that is possible but the situation remains unchanged I’ve decided to let go so God take control. Human reasoning has a limit, where it ends that’s where faith starts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we shall fear no evil! Greater is He who is in us than who is outside. By faith,&nbsp; we like Abraham shall overcome to His glory.

Measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise !”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unhealthy, egoistic. Opportunistic rivalry you name it; has no place in the church of the Living God yet our assemblies are filled with these negatives. Sisters comparing themselves with themselves; brothers comparing themselves with themselves!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These comparisons would have been greatly appreciated had they been in things spiritual; unfortunately, they are all in the material.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The church at Corinth comes to mind when we talk about rivalry, as a result of self-comparison! The church was riddled with rivalry so much so that Paul had to step in to stop it! Today we see the same spirit manifesting itself.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding sisters, it is who is more beautiful, dresses more cutely than the other, and has more fans as if beauty is forever, as if the church is a fashion parade! Just look at how “crumbled” your face and skin look today compared with how they looked a few years ago! Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My dear, no matter how much makeup you put in, they rather make you look weird than real. Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The late AB Crentsil in his evergreen song which I often listen to titled; “ Ye Wô A Dè OYè” made this remark about youthful girls who compare and boast of themselves. “ Bobby stand, back tyres are loose”. Yes! Such was many an old woman of yesterday! But how do they look today? A pale shadow!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is vain if not foolish to compare oneself to another. Everything about us is in transition, beauty fades! We are rendered valueless, as we age with time. Indeed, our greatest enemy is time!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the 70’s there was this popular song titled “Growing Old” A line reads “ I wish I’ll never grow old!” May we learn not to compete or compare ourselves with each other, these are vanities and create hatred and enmity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be happy and content with who you are. You are unique there is none like you. Be proud of who you are do not trade it for who or what someone else looks like!!! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As for me, I am in my own class! So you too, be in your own class, do not compare yourself with or to anybody. If you do as Paul said, you are not a wise person!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In life, there will always be someone higher or lower than you. Be yourself, if some does not like or love you, simply tell them “ they can go to hell and greet the devil, you don’t give a hoot!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 10:12&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] We do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves.

Selah.</p><p>4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This morning, in a chat with a sister, we both acknowledged the day as a gift and wished each other a blessed day. But before then came the question, “How do we spend a gift?” What use?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How beneficial a gift is depends on us. We’ve just received a gift of 24 hours! Before it expires at midnight today find out what you’ve been able to do with it.&nbsp; Do this with a pen in hand and paper by your side. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, these are questions many have never thought of nor asked themselves! Is it not true that most don’t put to good use any gift they received? When I was a student in the UK, there were county newspapers that advertised sales of goods. Some advertisers list goods they are offering for sale as “ unwanted gift!”&nbsp; Simply they don’t know what to do with them!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In our case, some of the gifts we receive are left to collect dust on tables, kitchens etc. If they are clothes they are left on hangers in wardrobes unused.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today is a gift what will you do with it? What you do with it will determine your future. Remember, today is what yesterday you called tomorrow! You had plans for it, therefore put them into action today!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To help you manage gifts here is what I do. Whenever I receive a gift I sit back and think about what to do with it to improve my life! I think through to find out how best the gift can help me achieve a goal-add value to my life. This is what every gift we receive should be seen and regarded.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is the proper and appropriate use of a gift that enhances life which we call a blessing. If today which is a gift will be a blessing to you then think and plan how to use it. Do this before you step out, make a list of priorities and see them through.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve been doing this for years and I have found it extremely helpful. I therefore recommend this approach to you. Make the most out of every day.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy the gift of Today. While doing so please do not forget the Giver.

Etc. Some of these messages are what we call “ kutia “ in twi! I leave the rest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But my attention was drawn to the above scriptures when I received a gift from someone I found difficult to remember, as it has been several years since we met. He took time to replay memories and finally, I got him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He told me how things I’ve said and taught have brought him great blessings over the years. He has tried to reach out to me with difficulty because he does not have my contact information.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truly I was humbled to hear him recount his experiences and attributed them to things he heard and learnt from me. It was then that this trotro inscription came to mind “ good never lost!”&nbsp; I don’t know if it is good English but it was very commonly used then&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, “ good never lost” that is what happened to Rahab. The same happened to the widow of Zarephath and several others that time and space will not allow me to list.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some have sent me money, items of great value etc because of what they have benefited from me in time past. I ask God’s abundant blessings upon these benefactors. In the darkest hours of my life, these have always extended hands of grace!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, cast thy bread upon the waters “ is indeed true advice which if obeyed will inure to our good. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are the equivalents of the blind man who returned to thank Jesus! Like Jesus asked, so also do I “Where are the nine?” It may include you the reader.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me conclude with the popular proverb “Those who drink from a Well they did not dig, should never forget those who dug it”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to all my benefactors!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>How To Speak So As Not To Be Called A Liar</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 4:25</p><p>NIV</p><p>[25] Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A simple instruction but very difficult to obey and apply. This instruction holds the key to a fruitful social interaction among friends or brothers of the same family-church!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve listened to many speak or say things only to be called liars, which is a strong derogatory term to describe a friend or a brother! But how did it get to that point? That is what this article intends to address.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We begin by asking what it means to speak “ falsely ?” It is to communicate or to speak, say things etc; without facts or evidence to support what one says. The opposite of this is to speak “ truthfully” A truthful statement is one based on facts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To speak from assumptions, to exaggerate, to speculate, to conjecture etc are all part of what can be described as speaking falsely, simply because they are not facts!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Assumptions, exaggerations, speculations etc are personal commentaries; there is nothing wrong with them, everyone has the right to express their views on a matter or subject. What is wrong is to affirm them as the truth and they must be obeyed by all</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, to avoid being classified or labelled as a “liar” when you speak from any of the above-listed, it is highly recommended that you begin your statements/presentations etc, with a “disclaimer”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A disclaimer stating that in” your considered view or opinion here is what you think”&nbsp; Let the audience know that what you are about to say is an assumption or deduction! This will help them know and understand your conclusions as “opinions”.&nbsp;</p><p>And indeed opinions they are and not a lie or falsehood because you’ve earlier issued a disclaimer.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that there are all types of “ opinions !”&nbsp; We have “ learned/educated opinions “ “ unlearned/, emotional opinions” fanatical opinions “ exaggerated opinions, consistent/inconsistent opinions! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like how Paul labelled and cautioned against entertaining some questions; maybe we may have to apply the same to some “opinions” so we avoid entertaining /commenting on some forms /types of opinions! Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>2 Timothy 2</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>23</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is when you did not issue any disclaimer but spoke as if they were facts, when what you said is found later to be untrue that is when you are a liar, because you’ve spoken falsely!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If what you say, teach, etc are accepted as “ opinions “ when the real facts are known you can change your views or opinions without any difficulty! You’ll win the respect of your hearers. This is maturity but where despite the facts you still hold to your “ opinions “ and proclaim them to be true then you will be labelled a liar!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This, beloved is a “disease” that has afflicted the majority! They have taught things that are based on assumptions, opinions etc now, in the light of the facts and evidence they still hold and believe their “ opinions” to be true!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An unfortunate development!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is wrong with admitting that something said/taught/believed etc in the past was wrong? One word describes such a stand or position; pride. And read ;&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>18+ Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 18</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 29</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, when confronted with facts and indisputable evidence may we eat our humble pie. Facts are sacred, opinions are free. In matters of faith ( facts ) unity , in matters of opinion , liberty. This 18th century</p><p>Common sense approach to unity is still valid&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let each express and hold fast to his opinions, he must also allow others to do the same. None must impose his opinions on any unless he believes and shares in the same opinions!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truth unites, opinions divide. Opt for the Truth so you can unite.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 4:25</p><p>NIV</p><p>[25] Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

I do so as a tribute to the many who taught me how to read and write. Without them, you’ll not read what you are reading from me!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After every school holiday, we were made to write a “ composition” with the topic&nbsp; “ How I spend My Holiday “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simple as it sounds but difficult to some of us! Why? Because we went nowhere, we sat here in Accra! But we were forced to write what we did anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Looking back, I realized this was where and when I discovered my creative writing skills that later improved with time as I climbed the educational ladder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have to imagine and create an interesting scene worth sharing! Unfortunately, there will be no such creative or imaginary scenes to be written about when our “ spiritual excursion “ is over.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is what Paul meant when he wrote ;</p><p>2 Corinthians 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>10+ For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So my dear reader, enjoy your excursion do what you like, go where you want or wish to go! No one will write or mark your “ composition “. It is you who will write and it is God who will mark!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you’ll pass or fail will depend on what you write and the Examiner-God. No elder, deacon, evangelist etc, will be asked to comment on your paper. The Examiner knows you better than they! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>None of them can influence the Examiner or the marking scheme in your favour! There it will be “ everybody for himself, God for us all”. So begin trying your hand in the way your “composition” will look like. Live in such a way as to write with no regrets.! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember the topic “ How I spend My years on Earth!”&nbsp; We are on an excursion let us enjoy the trip!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read how someone wrote his ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Years I spent in vanity and pride,</p><p>Caring not my Lord was crucified,</p><p>Knowing not it was for me He died</p><p>On Calvary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chorus:</p><p>Mercy there was great, and grace was free,</p><p>Pardon there was multiplied to me,</p><p>There my burdened soul found liberty -</p><p>At Calvary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How will you start yours?

It is not about how many people you have surrounding you, it is about the quality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Quality joy, quality happiness, is not a direct function of the many but the few that surround you. A man with fewer but sincere and genuine friends is better off than one with many hypocrites around</p><p>It is not about “ fans” but “ family “ Of trusted people!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I lived in England I noticed strangely though how some are passionate about keeping animals as friends. Dogs wear specially sewn cover coats, eat good food, and sleep in the same bed with their owners.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Initially, I was stunned and wondered why. It was later when l threw myself wholly into the ocean of humans and saw the infighting, bickering, Envy, jealousy, gossip etc that I realized how wise these men are.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dogs and cats don’t gossip, they don’t betray their masters, they are faithful and loyal to them! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These men kept a few genuine friends with whom they shared and enjoyed their lives. They shut out noise so they can listen to quality chat and conversation. Sika mpè dedè! Quality enjoyment is not about noise but serenity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you asked why few play or watch golf while the majority play or watch football? There are differences in enjoyment! Come to think of it, when you die how many people will we need to carry your coffin? 4!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be blunt, the more people you have in your life the more problems and challenges you face. The fewer the quieter and lesser the problems and challenges! This is not selfishness but peace of mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, if some throws you out of their company rejoice and be thankful. Our desire is to be found in the company of a few sincere and genuine friends. If you find such people don’t let them go!&nbsp; I’m looking for them!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought.&nbsp;</p>",

You’ll hear these say “ Oh next year I’ll buy this or do this or that then I will look like this or that”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To them it is all about the future, their twi slogan is what we’ve all heard since birth “ ebè yè yiè “ which never comes to be.&nbsp;</p><p>( Dreamers, fantasizers)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then there is the group that live their lives on a daily basis, these take on any challenge that comes their way without dwelling on or making comparisons/references etc to the past, nor postponing to another date or time called “ future.”</p><p>( Pragmatists)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the state in which you find yourself today indicates which of the three periods listed above you are living in. Your spiritual, social, economic etc state is a function of the time you live your life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you live in the past you’ll always be frustrated and disappointed with the present so much so that you’ll practically do little to nothing!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you live in the future, you’ll be doing nothing concrete today but delight in daydreaming. You’ll be thinking of a non-existent “future”; forgetting that each day is the future!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, you called today tomorrow which is the future that has come! There is no day or month called “ future” each day, each month etc is the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you live in the present the chances of making things happen and thus living a satisfied life are very high. You don’t postpone nor do you look back. Each day you take the bull by the horns, if it must be done then it is today and not tomorrow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What Jesus said is do not live in the future, live in the present, tackle today’s problems and challenges! If there is any tomorrow, it begins from today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is today that lays the foundation for tomorrow! A poor foundation today will guarantee you a poor tomorrow! So focus on today so that tomorrow will take care of itself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it again,</p><p>Matthew 6:34 NIV</p><p>[34] Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please remember He did not say “ don’t think” but “ don’t worry “&nbsp; there is a difference!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take.&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Songs, Hymns Of Memory:.What I Remember!&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 10</p><p>KJV</p><p>7+ The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Memories of good people, events, occasions and times flash through our minds very often but we are too busy to pause and reflect on them! I took time to reflect on one such memory here is how I felt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I happened to visit a church a few weeks ago, and during the worship service, a few old familiar hymns were sung! These were sung continuously, and the impact and effect they had on me made me stop singing and stand still!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why? Memories of the past began to rush through my mind I started seeing faces and moods of people who were with me when these songs were sung many years ago Unfortunately, though a few are alive the majority are no more. They’ve gone home!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know about you, but with me, songs in general ( spiritual or secular ) bring back memories whenever I hear them played or sung. They situate me precisely in time,&nbsp; place and the occasion! I often pause to relive and enjoy them. Something I highly recommend.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Such occasions made me feel young and it uplifts my spirit!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a Ghanaian version of Handel’s messiah which we called locally “ Hallelujah chorus” which was popularly sung in the 80s! When I hear it sung today (though a pale shadow of itself,) it brings back sweet memories of fellowship!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel the same when I hear some of the secular pop songs of the ‘60s and ‘70s they take me back to my youthful days.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The likes of Otis Redding,( I’ve Got Dreams!) Sam Cooke ( Chain Gang) Percy Sledge ( When A Man Loves A Woman) Wilson Pickett ( Midnight Hour) James Brown ( Papa’s Got A Brand New Bag) etc. not forgetting ABBA ( Super Trouper 80s)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Songs, hymns etc, be they spiritual or secular bring back memories I shared with friends I hope the same applies to you. They help revive and renew bonds of friendship long forgotten! I remember picking up my phone to call a friend after hearing an old song we both enjoyed in our youth!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So next time you hear a hymn or song let it remind you of the friendship, joy and happiness we shared sometime ago. The good times we shared, the love and admiration we had for each other before misunderstandings and foolishness “ parted us” Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us do this as quickly as we can because our departure time is here! Soon our flight will be announced, how prepared are we?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I conclude with what Paul wrote;</p><p>Romans 8:35,37-39&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[35] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[37] No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[38] For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[39] neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let nothing separate us, remember the good old days and times we shared! The fun, the laughter, the journeys we took together, the rides, the food we shared as we ate together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>O! Memories! Let us relive them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p>",

They are not solutions to the challenges faced by the bereaved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The thoughts I expressed are what James has also captured in the verses you’ve just read! Comforting and consoling words are not the solution to any problem, need, or challenge faced by anybody!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They are what they are “ comforting and consoling!”Words.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What James is saying is, to put it bluntly “ Words don’t fill the stomach of a hungry man, Words don’t put cloth on a naked man!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Words have their time and place, they act as “ soothing balm “ to a wounded person but are not the cure. It is like saying “ I am sorry “ to someone you’ve hurt or wronged. As I’ve written before, sorry does not heal or correct the wrong it only soothes the pain inflicted by the wrong done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved it is important we draw the line between words and actions. Actions we are told, speak louder than words. This is not to say words don’t “ speak” they do, but “actions” speak much louder, and it is the loudest sound that people hear and pay attention to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many a time, members bring their requests /problems/challenges etc to the church, seeking solutions; all they get is “ comforting and consoling Words “these are expressed or communicated through prayers!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the very scene James described above, he probably may have observed a congregation &nbsp;at a midweek prayer session! Two members stood up to mention their needs or predicaments.&nbsp;<br>And as usual, brother Q was asked to pray for them! And it ended there!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Brethren in Christ, &nbsp;let us wake up to the Realities Of Truth, there are many suffering from the disappointments we have inflicted on them by only speaking “ comforting and consoling “ Words To Them in their hour of need devoid of any action whatsoever</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A concern to raise! A solution to share! A charge to keep I have. My calling to fulfil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He who hath ears to hear let him hear! Soon we shall all stand in the witness box to be cross-examined, so put your Acts together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I came across some frightening images while watching some medical documentaries on human developmental stages. I saw pictures of children whose body shapes do not match their age. I was told it is called “ stunted growth”. It frightened me to be honest!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While pondering over these frightening images my thoughts settled on similar people I’ve come across in the fellowship! Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the causes of the stunted growth I learnt from the documentary are malnutrition! I noticed the same as the cause of the stunted growth of some in the church. Lacking proper spiritual nutrition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are those who have been in the church for years yet their attitudes, utterances etc do not match their years in the church. Stunted spiritual growth is a subtle disease that afflicts those who do not pay attention to their spiritual health.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Peter exhorted the&nbsp; newly baptized to pay attention to their growth, especially the diet they should take ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Peter 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul showed the way by feeding the newly established Corinthian brethren with milk; hoping that they would mature and transition to taking solid food, He was disappointed; read what he said to them;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</p><p>2+ I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Hebrew writer faced a similar situation; read his observation;</p><p>Hebrews 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>14+ But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He therefore challenged them,</p><p>Hebrews 6:1&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[1] Therefore let us move beyond the elementary teachings about Christ and be taken forward to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death, and of faith in God,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stunted growth can be found in the church which is a worry.

    "text": "<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The One Week Celebration Dilemma: Is It Scriptural Or Not? My Take&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why this subject should worry or be of concern beats the imagination! Here is an Event that did not originate with or from the Bible! It is not a biblical creation but that of society.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It did not originate from scripture but from society like all other non-biblical events that we see around it is a matter of choice to observe it or not. We are challenged as it were to think for ourselves in things that are not explicitly stated. Each has discretionary powers; use them;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1&nbsp;Corinthians 6</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>12</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 10</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>23</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question to ask is, is there anything biblically evil ( sinful) about it? If so this should be pointed out to help others know so they keep away from it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a subject matter that can not be settled by emotions, but by facts. If any has objections he should state them and cite the relevant scriptures! It is the Bible that settles every question, debate etc, and not emotions, not our likes dislikes or preferences!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Keep in mind that where there is no law there is no sin.&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a one-week observance to be a sin, the law prohibiting it must be quoted. Reference to any non-historical church precedents as reasons against it does not hold. It does not make an act sinful! Let the Bible speak! Let the Bible says so!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did the NT Churches observe a one-week event? We don’t know, it is not a religious event but social. It has nothing to do with salvation! Surely there will be a social arrangement regarding deaths or funerals just that they do not form part of matters concerning salvation! If they are a would have read it from the pages of Holy Scriptures&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is simply none. Salvation has nothing to do with observing or not observing. It is a matter of conscience. If your conscience tells you it is a sin don’t attend. And if you don’t, do not criticize those who do for you have no biblical book chapter or verse to support your stand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Come to think of it! What is wrong if a secular family invites believers to come join them in mourning a deceased member of their family who incidentally happens to be a member of the Christian family?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t forget every member belongs to two families, the physical and the spiritual.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A one-week observance is a family/friends affair, it is a loose social gathering anybody can attend if he/she is interested.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Any invitation to the church as a body should be treated as voluntary and not a mandatory demand or request. As a church you can refuse to honor it if there is sufficient biblical evidence to show that it is sinful!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The choice is yours. If you refuse to attend give biblical reasons why you can not join them as a Church You can choose not to attend as a church ( collective ) but as individuals! It may sound contradictory but such is the reality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a leader and you do not want to attend, that is you ; remember that the church does not belong to you but to Christ. You are a caretaker look into His constitution ( Bible) and quote the relevant laws /rules etc that He has given which forbid your participation as a church.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you find any such law /rule politely and respectfully notify in writing or word the family why as a Church you are unable to participate!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let not your argument be, It has not been done before, there is always a first time for doing something! Instead, show by the Bible and not your congregation’s history that the event is sinful. Sin is not what man thinks but what God says.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is sin that displeases God and will take us to hell not our opinions, likes or dislikes. Stay away if an act is sinful according to the scriptures.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A one-week observance is not scriptural, it is not mentioned in the Bible. It originated from society. The Bible is silent on both its origin and observance therefore to observe it or not is a matter of choice. It is one of the numerous daily decisions we make concerning things we do which are not written in the Bible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every choice or decision has its consequences it is up to the individual to convince himself and be prepared for any backlash be it good or bad.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Arguments in favour of participating are stronger than not participating. Ask these questions When a church attends what does she do? What role is she assigned? Is it not to pray and to preach? Are we not commanded to pray for all men? Are we not tasked to preach the Word to all men everywhere at anytime etc?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1&nbsp;Timothy 2</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>1&nbsp;</strong>I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Timothy 4</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>2</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are constantly looking for opportunities to preach and teach the Word, we program a house-to-house evangelism&nbsp; &nbsp;Most of the doors we knock are closed to us, lo and behold here is an opportunity where many have voluntarily assembled at no effort or cost to you. A free time slot is given to you to speak.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You are invited to come share the Word with them; and you are saying the arrangement is not biblical so you’ll not go! Oh oh!!!&nbsp; Please think again and think spiritually!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some have argued, oh they will play secular songs and drink alcohol etc. Is that your business? Will you be judged by what they do? Did they serve you with any and if they did; did you take it? Do you not know that your open rejection is a practical demonstration of your faith? Practical Christianity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you not heard before that at some of such gatherings the conduct of the church demonstrated through non-instrumental singing, the teaching of the truth etc won souls to Christ? Why can’t we for once think of the positive gains that can be made more than the negative ones?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A proverb came to mind as I pen these words “ it says there are bones in every fish, yet we eat them without being choked !” we do this by being meticulous, sieving out the bones from the flesh. To the majority everything is evil and must be avoided, so a one-week observation is evil.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have more to write but this is enough to state my position! If you are not in favour, I urge you to write your own. It was Chinua Achebe who said “ if someone writes something you don’t agree with, write your own!” instead of complaining, calling or labelling him!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

One would have wished the same to be extended to the person, our personal safety and security!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately these we have neglected which have been a source and cause of many a problem that has engulfed us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you know that there are four (4) main entrances ( physically ) to every human being? These are the eyes, nose, mouth and ears. Yes! Three ( ears, eyes and nose ) are inward entrances one ( mouth, tongue, ) is outward bound, but occasionally can be an inward bound entrance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every second these entrances received several knocks seeking permission to either enter or go out.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Except for the mouth, the eyes see many things every second, all attractive, luring etc wanting to be part of ( visit ) us. If the mind allows, it proceeds The same happens with the ears, and the nose!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many things are being said true, false, gossip, rumour, lies, etc; and the ears pick all, how the mind processes them is the challenge! What guard /barrier we erect at the entrances determines the direction our lives go.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All four (4) entrances to our mind are always under siege so guard these entrances. Many who have left them unattended to are in serious trouble with their lives. The evidence is there for all to see.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read a few recommendations and be guided;&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 21</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>3+ He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Job 29</p><p>KJV</p><p>11 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Job 34</p><p>KJV</p><p>3+ For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>31+ The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Set a guard over your mouth to regulate what goes out from it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Set a guard over your ears, to regulate what comes through them&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Set a guard over your eyes to regulate what it focuses on!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Set a guard over your nose to regulate /discern the scent it breathes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are not child’s play they require diligence and constant monitoring! Erect barriers to guard their entrances, this will guarantee you peaceful living, though occasionally you’ll make mistakes ( lower guards ) it will not affect much. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My observations as I went for a walk this morning! High walls, electric fences and entrance bells! All meant to keep away undesirables! Do something similar to yourself. Personal safety guard your eyes, mouth, ears and nose.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

[26] Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. [27] Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The above words form the bedrock of the life of any principled person! A conscientious person is focused, he does not look to the left or right. He fixes his gaze directly on what is at stake.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wants answers, he does not repeat questions he wants results he does not beat around the bush &nbsp; &nbsp;He is a pragmatist, to him it is what works that matters. Solutions&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He knows how dangerous distractions and distractors can be so he will not look either way nor listen to what is nothing but mere “theoretical noise”!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is&nbsp; next is he weighs carefully the paths he trod, as the writer said “ Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problem many have had is the failure to give careful thought or consideration to issues before concluding. Weigh the issues, convince yourself of what is true and right then take your stand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A principled person is not admired nor appreciated by many because he does not bend the rules, nor does he massage the truth. He is more often a loner. To choose this path in life you’ll make more enemies than friends! Even Jesus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a price every principled person has to pay. Joseph paid it, Moses paid it, Jesus paid it. Any man who stands in the way to prevent wrongdoing will pay this price.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul said it;</p><p>2 Timothy 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To “live godly in Christ Jesus “ is to simply uphold the principles of truth and uprightness regardless! So what path have you chosen for your feet?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are the broad and narrow paths, and each one of us is walking on one! Always examine your ways to see which path you’ve chosen for your feet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These thoughts came to mind when I found myself among a group that does not uphold principles, but delights rather in pleasing everyone! Good “image” at the expense of truth is what matters to them. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought and an experience to share&nbsp;</p>",

Just remember how you struggled to remember a name, a word, a dialect, etc things you knew off hand before. Yes, the effect of irregular use!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example in the 70s, when I lived and worked in Tamale I could speak and express myself in Dagbani, however after leaving the area for many years I&nbsp; lost control and command of the dialect. Sad.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Constancy and consistency are the keys to remembering everything we know. In our case, the Hebrew writer says our failure to&nbsp; remind ourselves of the Word of God will lead us into a spiritual disaster&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The word of God therefore is the believer's vaccine we must take a dose each day to keep the disease called “sin “ from attacking our souls. Failure to do this opens us up to sin to knock us down!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read how the Hebrew writer puts it “exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A dose a day of the Word does wonders spiritually! Every Sunday what we receive from the pulpit is a “booster dose” designed to keep our immune levels high throughout the week!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow this recommended approach to get the most from the spiritual vaccine, the Word of God!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be “sin-free” take a dose of the Word of God daily preferably before breakfast; the first thing after waking up from bed. Do it on an empty mind, when the mind is fresh and free from worry, stress etc</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is also recommended that for best results, after taking the vaccine you sit for a few minutes to let it settle in your mind! ( meditate) !&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do this at a time when there is no noise to cause distraction, pick no calls make no calls, read no text messages! These if done before taking the vaccine will render it ineffective as they distort the state of the mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To help enrich the vaccine’s effect on the heart /mind, hum or sing a song /hymn this is a choice and not a rule. After which pause and simply say “ Thank You Lord for yet another Day !” Be constant and consistent and you’ll never regret! Do it now!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share hope it helps.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Depending on which part of the world you live in, the storms may be strong or mild, but they are storms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the above scene, we need to understand that though we have the Lord with,&nbsp; and on our side, we shall not be spared the effects of the storms of life! As Christians, we are not immune to the hardships and frustrations associated with life</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The disciples we are told “ were in jeopardy “ the same we experience in the face of “storms” But what does it mean to be in “ jeopardy?” It means “to be at risk or threatened with serious harm, death, or damage”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a state or condition that creates anxiety, hopelessness and helplessness; have you not ever experienced this before? Oh, I have on many occasions! Read my confessions!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, this brings to mind the question posed by the hymn writer “Will your anchor hold in the storms of life ?”&nbsp; Hear Him;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Will your anchor hold in the storms of life, when the clouds unfold their wings of strife?</p><p>When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain, will your anchor drift, or firm remain?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh yes, there have been times when my “anchor of faith” in friends failed me at the most critical moments! When the strong tides of disappointments and frustrations lifted and my emotions were low, I needed just a touch of Hope and a pat on the shoulder! There my “ anchors “ failed me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anchor here can be anything you trust and believe can deliver you in times of distress. It could be friends, family,&nbsp; church members, colleagues at work, children, husband or wife etc..&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, on many occasions my anchor of faith in friends has come under stress when the clouds of mistrust unfolded themselves and engulfed me. When lies and falsehood are peddled freely like toffee! Trusted friends ( anchors!)&nbsp; deserted me! Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope was gone and I was nearly swept away. There was none to hold on to, the majority of my “anchors” failed to hold me in check and balance. Yes, this is a reality in life so watch and pray. Re-examine your anchors from time to time to be sure they will hold in time of need.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my case, it was then that a small circle of trusted friends ( anchors) took me in, extended a rope to pull me in from the brink of woe and disaster, an act similar to how Jesus calmed and stilled the storm!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, beloved there will be storms in our lives, our anchors shall be stretched beyond limits; some will fail to drop into the ocean of pain; but on these turbulent waves always remember how Jesus spoke and it became quiet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trust in Him fully and the storms will pass. He is the only genuine anchor you can trust. A tried and tested anchor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My confessions! A word to the wise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“ And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this !”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Great words from Mordecai to Queen Esther to remind her why she, a foreigner, was made a Queen. This was at a critical time in the lives of the exiled Jews!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When the news of the extreme suffering that the exiles were going through and the need to find solutions was made known to her she initially dragged her feet until her uncle made her understand what was probably unknown to her- God has placed you here for the redemption of His people!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mordecai did not stop there he further added “For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place,” Esther, my dear you are not indispensable!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How many people see their rise to influence as God’s divine arrangement for a purpose? How many understand that whatever they possess was bestowed by God for use in His service?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have we not read what Jesus said regarding privileges? Read it;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Luke 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>48+ ——-“For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How easy it is to forget this and act as if what or who we are is the result of our efforts therefore we owe no one anything! &nbsp;Who, what or wherever we find ourselves may it be known to us that God planted us there not only for the physical but also for a divine purpose. And should we fail Him, He can raise an alternative!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see these unfold every day but fail to recognize that God is involved. These manifest themselves as “ conflicts and rivalries” It happens when a person(s) in authority acts in a way to suggest he /she is indispensable! So a rival group emerges.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though on the surface “conflicts and rivalries” present a group with a challenge physically, yet in the spiritual realm sometimes it is the doing of the Lord.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve seen this phenomenon unfold in many congregations when either a song’s leader, teacher, preacher, leadership etc;&nbsp; etc as a result of the admiration and praise showered on him/ her becomes arrogant and develops the feeling/sense of indispensability! These act as if without them a congregation cannot function!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you not heard of some describing a group in the same congregation as “ rival/parallel etc leaders” who must be stopped? Yes, that is a sign that God is raising an alternative to do His work! When we fail God He will raise an alternative to replace us! Period.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, “rival leadership” emerges when existing leadership fails to deliver on their mandate, and sees themselves as “ indispensable “. We see this in politics when voters vote opposition parties into office to replace a ruling government!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you not seen this before in your group, when hitherto unknown replacements emerge spontaneously from among the audience, mostly persons no one has ever thought could perform the functions assigned? Oh, I have!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A new song leader emerges, a new bible class teacher takes up a bible class, new leadership is installed and suddenly positive results are the order of the day. Nobody is indispensable as far as God is concerned. We are disposables when our use is over.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anytime and anywhere there is a “ rivalry “ anyone exercising authority must sit up and do their own self-examination! Have I become arrogant, have I developed the mindset of being indispensable? Though not all rivalry/conflict is the doing of God, some are out of selfish ambition yet some are His doings! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>May we in authority or influence remind ourselves at all times that ;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Proverbs 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>18+ Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Proverbs 11</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mordecai told Esther, <i>“You are not indispensable, if you fail to act as expected of you, God will find us an alternative! “Hear him again;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>“For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place,”</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God can replace me, you etc so let us serve with humility and not with the feeling/sense of indispensability!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A word to the wise is enough!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

All who spurn instructions and advice in the end crash their lives! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many years ago I used to visit a large scrapyard located on the Tema-Kpone road.

The major fault or accident that took them there is “character flaws”. Flaws that could have been corrected had those there listened to instructions and advice as the proverb writer noted.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you visit scrapyards you’ll be surprised by the types of vehicles you’ll find there, expensive, good-looking looking etc cars what is most disturbing is to be told the type of accident (fault) that brought them there!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All the cars there have one fault in common; “character flaws” deficient in good character! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some are slightly dented ( damaged), and can be brought back to the road; whereas others are damaged beyond repair. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same applies to us humans, some refused to listen to instructions and advice no matter what, these are the damaged beyond repair cars in the scrapyard.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The slightly dented and brought back to the road are those who recognized their folly in time and traced their way back by heeding instructions and advice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Most of us belonged to the second category, we were once damaged cars in the scrapyard but the Gospel of light shone on us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read how Paul described us; he first listed the types (character flaws /weaknesses) of cars in the scrapyard ;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 6:9-10&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[9] Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men [10] nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A tall list, definitely you and I are listed among the cars in the yard! .

    "text": "<p>Salvation Is A Package: Not A Pick And Choose Bazaar!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 25</p><p>KJV</p><p>44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a conversation with a young sister, the issue of salvation came up, and this influenced this write-up. Some members believe that they are saved because they do or observe certain practices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Practices such as regular church attendance, observance of the Lord’s supper, free will giving as against tithing, singing without the accompaniment of instruments and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was “ worried “ and disturbed in spirit by what I heard as the basis for our salvation! Beloved salvation is a package, it is like a soup. Its taste is the result of the inclusion of many ingredients!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The activities that make our salvation complete are in two categories, the inner and outer activities. What the lady mentioned above is the inner activities, without the outer salvation is not complete.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The inner activities are done regularly whether sincerely or otherwise, only God knows. Some attend church regularly, do take the Lord’s supper alright but are very wicked and evil in heart and mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some break the bread, drink of the cup but harbor evil in their hearts against the next person sitting by her/him on the pew! Sundays are occasions where hypocrisy is on display!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe it would be better to name Sunday, “Hypocrisy Day”. But out of reverence for the Lord, such a name may not be proper! . &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see it, we know it etc but we are unable to speak! And you are telling me that just by breaking the bread and drinking the wine one is saved?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved , we came to this understanding because we have “ overhyped “ and “oversimplified” the following verses&nbsp;</p><p>John 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>54+ Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</p><p>56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truth be told these passages or practices are part of the salvation package and not a stand-alone! It is like baptism, if you are baptized and you do not lead a Christlike life will baptism alone save you?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You belong to the church with a biblical name yet your life/deeds etc do not reflect that of Christ! Will the church’s name alone save you?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many have been misled into believing that there are some essentials which when done or observed salvation is guaranteed to them. Beloved, salvation is a package made up is many parts none is a stand-alone. All must be observed&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who were questioned in the lesson text did you hear mention baptism or worship? They were questioned on the externals, benevolent acts!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who were condemned because they never practiced benevolence will surely protest their condemnation, they are like some of us who think salvation is about “ true worship” True worship is part of the package!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Listen to Paul concerning love as an example ;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 13:2-3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[2] If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[3] If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is our character outside the church building and that which we display in the building both put together make us acceptable in the Lord.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t make the grade/mark to Heaven please don’t say you were not told. Salvation is not a pick-and-choose buffet dinner. It is a package, you accept all or leave it!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do not be deceived into believing that what is done on Sundays is all that is required. Now you know advise yourself!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The passage conveys the thought that there are limits to how far we can get ourselves involved in other people’s affairs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve all read or at least heard of the death or injury sustained by some innocent persons who tried to stop a fight between two people. Or rush into “quarrels that are not their own !”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The proverb writer said, If you grab the ears of a stray dog it will definitely bite you. I tried to think through what this means by comparing how my dog behaves when I grab his ears. In my case, he remains calm and is happy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So I asked why, Well it’s because it is a trained and domesticated dog. This behavior is contrary to that of “ a stray “ dog! A domesticated dog knows and respects its master something different from what a “stray” dog will do. And so are quarrels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A dog you don’t know will not listen let alone respect you, and the same is a quarrel involving persons you don’t know! A situation which is different from that between persons you know. Remember, in settling a quarrel one brings his image and influence to bear on the combatants which can only be effective if they know him/her..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is what the proverb writer is drawing attention to, do not rush into a quarrel that is not “your own” which means a quarrel involving people you don’t know! The consequences as he said, are what a stray dog will do to you if you hold its ears.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A quarrel that is “your own” is a quarrel involving people you know, they will listen and respect your intervention and peace will be restored.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, after reading the above text as a meditational passage I felt I should share my thoughts with you! It is better to be “invited “ than to “rush” into a quarrel that is not your own. I accept that some situations /circumstances are exempt, but in general, let this rule be a guide.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Every quarrel has its “owners”. Rush (attend) to that which is your own!” Know how to mind your own business when it comes to quarrels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Not all sounds are the same, to understand what a sound means, one must be trained.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second coming of the Lord we are told shall be preceded by the sound of a trumpet.&nbsp;</p><p>But before then it appears there will first be a trumpet sound which all those who hear will be resurrected and be transformed&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</p><p>52+ In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of the Lord’s descent here is how the event is described;</p><p>1 Thessalonians 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It lists two occurrences; these are “with a shout” a shout is not a sound made by a trumpet but by a human (?) “ with the voice of the archangel “ it seems this is the person who will do the “shouting”, then follows the sound “ and with the trump of God “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The “shout” is likely to be made by the archangel, the trump of God will then blow a message both of which the “ dead in Christ “ shall hear and rise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What will be said by way of the shouting we are not told. The type of sound the trumpet will make we are also not told; these are mysteries!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to believe that both the shout and the sound the trumpet will make will be understood by the Spirit in every believer.

A careful look seems to suggest that these events will take place simultaneously, first the shout summoning the “ dead in Christ “ to rise after which follows the rest, “the living in Christ(?)”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is because we the living shall not “ precede” the dead in Christ. We shall have to wait for them to rise first before we join them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Thessalonians 4:15&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[15] According to the Lord's word, we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that time will cease to be reckoned so there is nothing like Day or night, twenty-four hours etc. Because time will cease to operate as we know it these events will therefore follow sequentially. It will not be time-based.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are my opinions regarding the end-time events as I read them! They are not doctrine but opinions. You may have your own!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Redeemed of the Earth shall be summoned by a “shout” by an archangel and a “sound” from a trumpet both of which shall be heard and understood only by those who have the Holy Spirit in them, believers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember anyone who does not have the spirit of Christ in him does not belong to Him;&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>9+ But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The end-time communication will be a spiritual communication between spirits. To make it easier for the spirit we are marked (sealed) by God for identification purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it,</p><p>Ephesians 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, remember that at baptism you received the Holy Spirit as a Gift;</p><p>Acts 2:38</p><p>NIV</p><p>Peter replied, \"Repent and be baptised, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.

    "text": "<p>He Sealed My Pardon With His Blood!</p><p>1 Corinthians 15:3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[3] For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This morning at service I joined to sing the hymn “ Man of Sorrows” while singing I was struck by these words of the hymn-writer “&nbsp; he sealed my pardon with his blood”. I paused to think and reflect on these words, which meant a lot to me. I share this with you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From the Apostle Paul’s perspective, the most important thing we should remember in Christianity is “ he sealed our pardon with his blood”. This he expressed in these words; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 15:3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[3] For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“He died for our sins” is the same as saying “ he sealed our pardon with his blood”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which again is similar to another aspect of his life, he ( Paul) wrote about;&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 8:9&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[9] For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did he seal our pardon with his blood but he also made himself poor to make us rich. This is love.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Again we are told he made himself of “ no reputation” he gave up his honor so that we may be honoured. It is for these reasons that I owe Him my life and my everything! If it had not been for the sacrifices he made I would have been nothing. Paul knew this hence he said ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Galatians 6:14&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[14] May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If any will boast, beloved let him boast in the One “ who sealed his pardon with his blood! “. Who also became poor to make him rich! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, He took my sins and my sorrows, He made them His very own. Read how another hymn-writer expressed his feelings;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stand amazed in the presence</p><p>&nbsp; Of Jesus the Nazarene,</p><p>And wonder how He could love me,</p><p>&nbsp; A sinner condemned, unclean.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(How marvelous! How wonderful!</p><p>&nbsp; And my song shall ever be:</p><p>How marvelous! How wonderful!</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Is my Savior’s love for me!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>For me, it was in the garden,</p><p>&nbsp; He prayed: “Not my will, but Thine.”</p><p>He had no tears for His own griefs,</p><p>&nbsp; But sweat-drops of blood for mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3</p><p>In pity angels beheld Him,</p><p>&nbsp; And came from the world of light</p><p>To strengthen Him in the sorrows</p><p>&nbsp; He bore for my soul that night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4</p><p>He took my sins and my sorrows,</p><p>&nbsp; He made them His very own;</p><p>He bore the burden to Calv’ry,</p><p>&nbsp; And suffered, and died alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5</p><p>When with the ransomed in glory</p><p>&nbsp; His face I at last shall see,</p><p>’Twill be my joy through the ages</p><p>&nbsp; To sing of His love for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I owe everything to Him, my thoughts as I meditate on the phrase “He sealed my pardon with His blood”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maranatha</p>",

These are those who are exalted by men, men bestowed with worldly glories and honors. These are men who are known and highly admired here on&nbsp; Earth. These are people who die and their glories die and are buried with them!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Glorified immortals” are those glorified and exalted by God as described in our text verse above! These are those whose names are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life; their glories never fade or die because they live forever, and their glorification (exaltation) is by God and not man. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every Believer is a potential glorified immortal, whose glorification will take place on the Day of the Resurrection.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because flesh and blood ( mortal) can not inherit the kingdom, a transformation must first take place before the coronation (glorification )</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read how Paul described it,&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 15:50-54&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[50] I declare to you, brothers and sisters, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[51] Listen, I tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed---&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[52] in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[53] For the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[54] When the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable, and the mortal with immortality, then the saying that is written will come true: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is what will precede the coronation that transforms us into “ immortals “ and crowns us with glory. Hence becoming “ glorified immortals “.&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, make every effort to be counted worthy of this honor and title “ glorified immortal”. The world has its “ glorified mortals “ but you; aspire to be Heaven’s “glorified immortal”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Seek therefore no glorification here, rather seek that which is above which never fades nor dies!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maranatha.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Is It An Act Of Cowardice?</p><p>2 Samuel 15:14</p><p>NIV</p><p>[14] Then David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “Come! We must flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom. We must leave immediately, or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin on us and put the city to the sword.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There comes a time when our choices may be seen or described as cowardice; for example to beat a retreat in the face of danger. A danger one can easily overcome, a case in point is what you’ve read!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, hearing of falsehoods being spread like wildfire just to destroy your name and image, lies you can disprove and yet you choose not to! Is it an act of cowardice?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David the king was compelled to flee when he received the news of an imminent attack by his own child. Was it cowardice or an act of wisdom? &nbsp;</p><p>Of importance in taking this decision, David considered the long-term effects; the “fallout “ or the &nbsp;“ consequences “!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are several instances when similar developments occurred in the lives of prominent personalities in the Bible. Read a few;&nbsp;</p><p>John 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</p><p>2+ The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John 19</p><p>KJV</p><p>38+ And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John 7</p><p>KJV</p><p>50+ Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</p><p>51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 9</p><p>KJV</p><p>24 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</p><p>25+ Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There comes a time when beating a retreat is not an act of cowardice, but is dictated by wisdom. It is not easy though but it is the right thing to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus did a similar thing when in the midst of provocations falsehoods and accusations he held his peace, which posture that amazed both the Chief Priest and Pilate&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 26</p><p>KJV</p><p>62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? Behold how many things they witness against thee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5+ But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the midst of provocations and one holds his peace when in fact he can speak is not an act of cowardice, but an act of wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When in the face of danger, a danger that one can easily overcome yet walks away, is not an act of cowardice but wisdom. As seen in the case of Paul being put in a basket!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may not be understood, yet this action will turn out to be your honor! It is about ruling one’s spirit. Many will accuse and say all manner of things falsely against you, but learn to rule your spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 16</p><p>KJV</p><p>32+ He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 25</p><p>KJV</p><p>28+ He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Difficult lessons to learn, but they are the steps we must climb if we must reach the height of maturity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share with you&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

That a brother from the same womb can slay his brother?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In life, we all have our fears no one is exempt! There are many things that we fear but on a list of fears some are topmost. Not all put fears in us to the same degree.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among the many things I fear in life this is one of the topmost, a brother literally killing a brother !! What makes it difficult for me to understand is the fact that in the case of these two, God stepped in, to reconcile them. And Yet!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>God spoke in private with Cain yet Cain did what he had planned to do -to kill his brother. Not even God’s intervention could stop him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is where I fear humans, there are some of Cain’s great great, grandchildren living among us today. You may have seen them just that you did not recognize whose grandchildren they are.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By their fruits you’ll know them. These are those who harbour grudges, ill feelings, etc,&nbsp; and have planned to take revenge at the least opportune time they get.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not even preachings, teachings, pleadings etc not even time can stop them just like how God’s intervention could not stop Cain.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cain killed Abel probably with a club, hoe, Stone etc. an object but his grandchildren of today do it with the tongue. Which is more dangerous than using an object. Dangerous because you can not see it coming!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Abel likely saw the object Cain used just that he could not avoid it! In our case, the tongue is hidden, enclosed and covered by the teeth. All you see is the teeth that are bared and pretend to be smiling!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am sure Abel while dying may have uttered a few words. Words such as “ o my brother !”&nbsp; O what have l done? O why do this to me?</p><p>Are we not brothers?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, the same we also say to his great great grandchildren today who slay us with their tongues! Just as Cain was driven by envy so are they today. Envy knows no appeasement. It burns like wildfire</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If there is any person or group I feared most in life it is Cain’s ancestors. His “spiritual assassination squad “has terrorized and continues to To do so to many!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We solicit your prayers that God should grant us the strength and wisdom to live and endure the bruises and hurts inflicted on us. We are knocked down but not knocked out!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is my fear in life, not poverty not hunger, but the unconscious stabbing in the back by a brother/sister! Just like Cain did!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My fear I confess!&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>When God’s Message Becomes A “Burden”.&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you know that in ancient times, messages from God were called “burdens \"? This was so-called because the messages were most often “unpleasant ”to the recipients!! However, the usage was figurative.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read what Jeremiah was told to say in response to the people’s inquiries concerning God’s word to them.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremiah 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>33+ And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, it appears the term was “coined” &nbsp; by the people and was so used by God to address them; it is important to note that God communicates or addresses us using words that we use or are familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve read before the “hand” of God! His “ears” are not deaf, the eyes etc. God is spirit and spirit does not have ears, hands ears etc. Yet He is described as having them! We called this “ anthropomorphism”!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t worry your head if you don’t know it or can’t pronounce it. You’ll go to heaven or hell whether you know it or not!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As stated earlier the word “ burden” was a terminology possibly “coined” by the people. Read this&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremiah 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>38 But since ye say, The burden of the Lord; therefore thus saith the Lord; Because ye say this word, The burden of the Lord, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the Lord;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read a few examples ;&nbsp;</p><p>(The Burden of Babylon ) message to Babylon&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>19+ And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(The burden of Moab)</p><p>Isaiah 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(The Burden Of Damascus)&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 17</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.</p><p>2+ The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(The Burden Of Egypt)&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 19</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ The burden of Egypt. Behold, the Lord rideth upon a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joel 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>19+ Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>( Tyre And Tarshish)&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>( Nineveh)&nbsp;</p><p>Nahum 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Israel)</p><p>Malachi 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>1 The burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Miscellaneous prophecies “burdens” )</p><p>Isaiah 21</p><p>KJV</p><p>11+ The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>6+ The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Very interesting, God’s messages of warning and correction are to the recipients a burden”. We are not different from them, many today see messages intended to warn, correct and help them as “ burdens”! As a result, they turn a deaf ear or delete them!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the prophets of old, who care if our messages are heard, read or deleted! A speaker, writer etc like the prophets of old is under divine obligation to speak /write etc, God’s message! Be it a “ burden “ or not!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read how Paul said it;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 9</p><p>KJV</p><p><strong>16</strong><i><strong>+</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read how the term “burden” probably began ;&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremiah 23</p><p>KJV</p><p>33+ And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the Lord? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden?

He knew the enormity of the task and the burden he carried hence he often took time off to be alone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>C.S. Lewis is credited with urging his readers to “&nbsp; set aside time for solitary thoughts “ ( in his book Christian Behaviour), which he learnt from studying the life of Christ. And beloved, this is true and wise advice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Contrary to what most think about being alone, as a child of God, you must set aside time to be alone to think through your life’s activities and challenges. This helps identify both problems and solutions!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, several books were written by their authors when they were in solitary confinement! Paul is one, some of his epistles were written from solitary confinement. Solitary confinement inspires, creates and generates ideas and visions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The complex nature and the speed at which society is moving, demand that we undertake such a solitary exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Lord did this very often and so must we if we must overcome the numerous complex challenges that confront us daily; and here is how to go about it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Find a place that is free from noise and distraction, switch off your phone and go offline. Lie down and play back events that have taken place in your life during a certain period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do this with a pen and paper by your side so you can record thoughts, ideas etc that come to mind. Ask yourself hard questions, create or imagine scenarios list down how you’ll tackle or answer such questions in real-life settings.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Before you leave to join mainstream society, prepare a roadmap to guide you when you set out to implement your thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learn to spend time alone to develop and improve your thoughts about life and living; both spiritual and secular.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spontaneous thoughts are fine, but the refined are the best and these come through spending time alone.

For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The above-cited verse is commonly read to make the point that when we give we get more, but do you know that the same principle applies to the evil we do?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, “the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.” Some call it “Khama” I don’t know who this “Khama “ is but I know that to every action there is a reaction!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Bible confirms this when it states “ whatsoever a man sows the same shall he reap” which is an eternal law, eternal truth and an eternal warning! Yes!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Good receives good, in the same spirit evil receives evil in return. If the evil we do to others ( unless we repent and ask for forgiveness) do not receive its equivalent then the scriptures are not true.

It is not in us to take revenge or bless anyone for either the good or evil done to us. It is in the hands of God.

To them, it is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. They wait patiently till they get the chance or opportunity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Until they’ve.” cursed and or spread false news, rumours etc, about you, thus destroying your name and reputation they’ll never rest “. Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The psalmist Of Old expressed his trust in God to act on his behalf; though it sounds like a frustrated cry! Hear him.&nbsp;</p><p>Psalms 94</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, it takes time but surely God will avenge!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally a warning to those who rewardeth good done them with evil. Read it, &nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 17</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, yes good or evil done receives equivalent payments, so watch your ways who knows perhaps what you are going through today may be payments for either.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Memorials, Their Essence.&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 22</p><p>KJV</p><p>19+ And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question of how we would be remembered is a question about “ memorials “What is there to serve as your memorial? &nbsp;It should not be your tombstone., it should be something beyond this!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truly, not many cared about this but beloved, we must pause and reflect on this important subject. Memorials.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If memorials are not important, why would the Lord and several others we read about in the Bible take time to institute them?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, how one would be remembered ( a memorial ) can be a conscious or an unconscious decision!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can decide how you should be remembered by being specific as is the case with the Lord &nbsp; From the passage above, the Lord was specific in what should be done as a memorial&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another example is that of Absalom the renegade son of David, in his case, he was interested in having his name remembered by an object. Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>2 Samuel 18</p><p>KJV</p><p>18+ Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joshua And Israel ;&nbsp;</p><p>Joshua 4:6-7&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[6] to serve as a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, 'What do these stones mean?'&nbsp;</p><p>[7] tell them that the flow of the Jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. These stones are to be a memorial to the people of Israel forever.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Samuel and Israel ;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Samuel 7</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben–ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see similar examples around us, buildings with names inscribed on them. Statues and benevolent acts are another. These are conscious and deliberate decisions to immortalize or keep a person’s memory alive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What this means is you can institute, erect, construct etc in your lifetime an edifice or a practice as a memorial and instruct family members to keep and maintain it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus left us with the Supper as a memorial and as often as we break the Bread and drink of the fruit of the Vine we are remembering Him ( his death); till He returns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, there are acts of remembrance ( memorials) that come into existence unconsciously! One never instructed nor instituted them rather posterity brings them into being by way of remembering someone&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Biblically we see these from the following;</p><p>Dorcas, was associated with benevolent acts.&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 9:39&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[39] Peter went with them, and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was still with them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The unnamed woman; also a benevolent act&nbsp;</p><p>Mark 14:8-9&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[8] She did what she could. She poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial. [9] Truly I tell you, wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Scriptures abound in many such examples but time and space will not allow for a full presentation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, what should be your memorial? It can be a conscious or an unconscious decision. You can initiate a benevolent act and instruct generations after you to continue as a memorial!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A fund, a scholarship, a “ widows mite” project or program etc a specific one. Or build a KVIP, a classroom block, etc anything that seeks to promote the well-being of humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is what we should know about a memorial act. A memorial is not about “self glorification” No! But as an example to be emulated; a practical lesson for all to learn!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Jesus did not institute the Supper to glorify Himself, he does not need self-glorification He is God! Instead, He did it to confirm in practice what He taught His followers&nbsp; Read this ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John 15</p><p>KJV</p><p>13+ Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is what the Lord’s Supper was meant to confirm in practice; and what we should learn, practice etc as believers. He died that we may live. He gave that we may have.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, we’ve missed the essence of the memorial. We observe the Supper but live opposite lives. We miss the lessons it was meant to illustrate-laying down our lives for one another.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, memorials ( remembrances) are not meant to glorify but to teach the virtues lived and pursued by the one whose memorial is being observed.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A street name does not glorify the person whose name is on the plate but brings to mind what he lived and died for. It is meant to inspire, challenge etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I know a Sister who on every birthday goes to offer free service to an elderly person, she sweeps, cleans, tidies up the home, buys and prepares soup /food etc and eats with the particular elderly person of choice.&nbsp;</p><p>This is her memorial.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I know of another who takes food items every birthday to the mental hospital! This is his memorial.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After reading these what comes to mind? Yes, your memorial should inspire and be an example to others. Whatever you do is not ( should not) be meant to glorify or show how rich you are but rather to serve as an example of what should be done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is why Jesus indicated who we should invite to a celebration;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 14:12-14</p><p>NIV</p><p>[12] Then Jesus said to his host, “When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors; if you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[13] But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, [14] and you will be blessed. Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This may seem difficult, not at all He is saying “ blend the invited “ let the invited be made up of the rich and the poor “. One will invite you to his party on another day, the other will not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To the one who will not, what you’ve done will be your memorial! So you see what the Lord meant?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Leave a Memorial.&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Many are citing us as references to what the scriptures say about the Church.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our stand on free will giving as against mainstream tithing, our stand on upholding the Bible as the rule, and lately the scriptural command that singing be a acapella (non-instrumental) has been making news lately&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a “ tiktoker”, I have followed with great interest and admiration how some congregations have showcased the singing groups in their assemblies&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These groups have beautifully sung and demonstrated the beauty of non-instrumental singing thus affirming and confirming what the scriptures say! Many churchgoers have been made to believe that without instrumental singing church music is poor!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have preached and taught the doctrine of a acapella singing, these are seen as “theoretical” but with these groups putting these teachings into practice many outside the fellowship are now beginning to see the real picture. The truth is now being established through these groups.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is like what John said “ the word became flesh “ theory becoming real through these singing groups among us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember the Holy Spirit gave gifts for the building up of the church, there are diversities of gifts. We must accept and encourage those gifted to use their voices to sing. These have a place in the ministry if we know how to tap and direct them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some may argue the NT does not mention them, of course the NT does not mention several others but they find expression in today’s church arrangements.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are part of what we call the “ expediencies”! They are not mentioned explicitly, but they are needed to fulfil the work of the church.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The “music ministry” is attracting many a youth to the church, as they find meaning in the natural use of the voice. These practices ( singing) say nothing about anyone except Jesus and the Gospel.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They are not a choir but gifted singers desirous of deploying their gifts to serve the God who bestowed them on them. Like a preacher, deacon, elders etc they shall all give account to God of their stewardship. So why should we exclude and stifle them? &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today the Ghanaian religious landscape is waking up from the religious deception and spiritual stupor they’ve been taught.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let any congregation that has singers encourage them. They are demonstrating what we have taught /preached for decades regarding non-instrumental music.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It takes a humble study and the guidance of the Holy Spirit to appreciate what is unfolding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

They do so over a little refreshment prepared for them!&nbsp;</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(2)</p><p>&nbsp;Elsewhere tea and biscuits are served prepared from the church’s kitchen! In attendance are elders, deacons ( with their wives) men and women leaders of the assembly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conversations during these meetings are more about social, community events, challenges they are facing and how they are coping. The intent is to get them to vent out their feelings and frustrations!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>(3)</li><li>Elsewhere days are set aside in the week where they assemble at the meeting house to pray and engage in fraternal tolis!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>(4)</li><li>Elsewhere the young people are encouraged to go visit and assist them in clean-ups on specific days. Women /men leaders visit them to share fellowship!&nbsp;</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Loneliness is a “ killer” as these elderly are deeply submerged in thoughts and challenges that they find no one to listen to and assist.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are a few observations and thoughts I gathered as I visited to worship with churches. I pray they ignite discussions about our elderly members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They anticipate and look forward to the Sunday gathering let us therefore make the “Day” one full of joy and memorable! It will take another seven days before they meet us again! .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>What Did We Bring, And What Can We Take With Us?&nbsp;</p><p>1 Timothy 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>7+ For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What did we bring and what can we take with us; both have a simple answer! Nothing. If this is the case then what manner of persons should we be? Here is where we have the challenge and the difficulty.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read what one man who bore witness to this truth said; &nbsp;</p><p>Job 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>21+ And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a profound admission of the futility of trying to act as if one can take something away. Furthermore, the reality of this truth comes to life when we attend the funerals of men and women of substance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No matter how elaborate and expensive everything done is, the fact remains the same; they take nothing along! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly,&nbsp; some have misinterpreted this to mean that poverty is a virtue, so they disdain riches.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, like everything in life we must each make a choice, to be poor or rich is a choice. I admit that this statement is debatable! Some factors and preconditions decide which is which.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, so we ask, of what use then are the riches we come by while we live? Does it mean we should not acquire anything just because we shall not take them with us?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly there are some statements which if not studied carefully will seek to create the impression that it is useless to acquire anything in life.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read this&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psalms 49</p><p>KJV</p><p>17+ For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is God therefore against our labor? Is He against enjoyment? Surely God is not against our enjoying whatever we have gained through our labor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read what Paul wrote ;</p><p>1 Timothy 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>17+ Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>18 That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, God blesses us with riches to be enjoyed but not selfishly! So, yes we brought nothing and will take nothing out, but while here let us enjoy whatever we have acquired. Just that we “ should remember the poor”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So dress well, but remember to help clothe your neighbor who needs clothing. Yes eat good food, but remember to provide the disadvantage with some. Whatever you do let it trickle down to the man on the street.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Solomon summed up the above in these words; He was satisfied with the returns ( investments) of his labor; these empowered him financially hence he denied himself of nothing!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Please read the following to understand and not to judge; We see this in real life, people whose “returns on their investments” ( labor) are high enough do buy cars of their choice and build&nbsp; houses etc,&nbsp; 👇</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>10+ And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy some of what you’ve toiled for, “for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>24+ There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pay attention to this “that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour.”&nbsp; (In his labor, His toil etc !) Key Word is “ labour”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</p><p>13+ And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>22+ Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>15+ Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>18+ Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him: for it is his portion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Time and space will fail me, this is sufficient to establish the fact that we must labor and enjoy the fruits thereof! For we shall certainly not take anything with us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever you do people will talk about you, if you are poor or rich they will talk about you, do not let this prevent you from enjoying whatever God has blessed you with through your labor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wiasè mû nià wabrè nà odiè!

    "text": "<p>A Generous Heart: What It Looks Like!&nbsp;</p><p>2 Samuel 24:24&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[24] But the king replied to Araunah, “No, I insist on paying you for it. I will not sacrifice to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.” So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A generous heart is a heart that loves beyond measure, a heart that goes the extra mile and this is what David demonstrated as recorded above.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ordinarily, anyone in his shoes would accept Araunah’s offer or gift, but David knowing what He intended to use the property for, declined.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of accepting a gift he insisted on paying because the property was meant for the service of God. David wants to feel it deep down in his heart that he made a sacrifice.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He wants to demonstrate to God his personal deep appreciation of whatever God has done for him! Such thoughts and acts come from people who remember where they are coming from, and who helped bring them to their present status.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve seen, read or heard of people who in their bid to show their deep appreciation to someone who has been a source of great blessing to them either build a house, buy a car, sponsor a trip /holiday etc these they do from their toil and labor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But why, some may ask! Well, there is a feeling of inner joy, and satisfaction that one has done something. I remember on my return from studies abroad I looked out for the man whose nurturing, guidance etc facilitated my winning the scholarship that took me abroad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It took me a long search and inquiry to find him because he had retired from public service and no one knew his whereabouts! I could have given up the search and excused my conscience since there was no clue to finding him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I was determined to show my gratitude since whatever I’ve become was a result of his coming into my life. The transformation my life went through I owe it to him.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note,&nbsp; it is God who does everything but He does them through humans! God answers prayers, yes he does it through the agency of Man so it is not a sin to thank anyone through whom God answered our prayers!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The case of the Ten Lepers reminds us of the lesson of gratitude!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, the key lesson from David’s example is we must show our appreciation to God in a way or manner that will make us feel we have done something! A memorial!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was a time when a prophet told some who faced a similar situation;</p><p>Micah 6:6-8&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>With what shall I come before the LORD and bow down before the exalted God? Shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? [7] Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Shall I offer my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read what they were told and asked to do, ( obedience )&nbsp;</p><p>[8] He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the LORD require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some examples of what we can do from David’s account as read above. He was buying the property to be developed as a place to house an altar for God!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Samuel 24:25&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[25] David built an altar to the Lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. Then the Lord answered his prayer in behalf of the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We can do the same, by buying pews, chairs, Bibles, pulpits etc; artefacts for use by the church. Whatever one can think of as a show of one’s appreciation for what God has done&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you not read or heard of someone building a house for his parents as a show of gratitude? A thing of value that cost them a lot yet they did it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What have you done for God, or for someone who has greatly impacted and transformed your life? Something you did and felt satisfied in spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Remember your class one teacher” was an inscription I read written on a trotro many years ago! Another was “ Girl bî Ntî!” all meant to direct our thoughts and a debt of gratitude!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do you have a heart of gratitude, let it be seen through your deeds.

    "text": "<p>Is It Possible: Demon In A Believer?&nbsp;</p><p>Ephesians 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve been asked on several occasions by many if there can be any in the church who dabble in spiritism? Or possessed? I must confess this is a difficult question to answer, even if answered many will not understand! As a result, I’ve always shied away from answering.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What makes it a difficult question is the fact that a believer has the Holy Spirit living in Him! And the Holy Spirit can not coexist with an Evil spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I admit this to be true. It is the ideal situation ordinarily that should be the case, however, the reality is far from the ideal. It is not every Believer who has fully yielded ( surrendered) his/her life to the control of the Holy Spirit!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see this by observing the life/activities etc of professing members. I must admit surrendering fully to the Holy Spirit’s control and guidance is a “ battle “!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is always an ongoing “ civil war “ in every Believer. It is a daily constant battle. Victory in this battle is not absolute as it is progressive, won little by little!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some have won their battle with the spirit of “ envy, hate, gossip, rumour, lying, anger, greed, etc etc &nbsp; Do take stock of which battles you’ve won, and which you are still battling.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the question, here is my blunt answer! . My outright answer is yes! A believer can have the spirit of “spiritism” though he/she is in the church. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what is “ spiritism?” The Word is an “umbrella” word underneath which are every form of spiritual acts/practices/attitudes that are contrary to the recommended acts/practices/attitudes of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a simple layman’s definition for discussion purposes. Time and space will not allow me to list these acts but they are found on the pages of scriptures!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Spiritism” is a negative word! Any anti-godly ( ungodly) behaviour initiated, guided and controlled by&nbsp; Evil Spirits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To repeat, any spiritual practice/behaviour that is contrary to that initiated, influenced and directed by the Holy Spirit is “ spiritism” and is evil&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By this broad-based definition, it follows that any act/practice etc undertaken by a believer which is contrary to scripture is an act/practice initiated, influenced and guided by Satan -spiritism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So to the question “ can there be a church member who dabbles in spiritism? The answer is yes!&nbsp;</p><p>There is this term “ works of the flesh” an umbrella word which covers acts/practices etc, that are contrary to “ works of the spirit” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Paul in&nbsp; Romans and Galatians identified and listed these ! Read them for yourself. Among the list you’ll find these “envy idolatry witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can we rule out ( deny) that we don’t see or feel the presence of these in our gatherings? We do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People with evil spirits ( the listed ) do frequent and worship with us!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a similar occurrence in a Synagogue during Jesus’ time.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark 1:23-26</p><p>NIV</p><p>[23] Just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an impure spirit cried out, [24] “What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are---the Holy One of God!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[25] “Be quiet!” said Jesus sternly. “Come out of him!” [26] The impure spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you notice where he was? In the Synagogue of all places. So do not underestimate the spiritual war we are fighting, the enemies are “both from within and without”. Of the two, the most subtle and dangerous is the one from within! This is because they have “ free and unlimited access to you” so they can strike you down at any time&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pray for the spirit of enlightenment that your spiritual eyes will be illuminated!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These manifest themselves through human agents. Some of whom can be found among us!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My take&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>What Shall Be!: My Random Thoughts.&nbsp;</p><p>Job 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>9+ (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 6</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 9</p><p>KJV</p><p>5+ For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up, I’ve always wondered if the Dead see what takes place after they are gone. I’m not alone in thinking about this question. Opinions are divided; some say yes, while others say no.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly, this is a question with diverse answers, those who answer yes, tell us they speak from experience! Those who answer in the negative also say they speak from experience, these make the point that if it’s true then why have things gone bad when the dead could have intervened? Hmmm,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I took time to read, observe and study what happens when loved ones pass away, and from experience, the above verses sum up what transpires! “For who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun? “for the memory of them is forgotten.” !&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hard truths that the we must hear and let it guide the steps we take and the things we do!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Gas have a proverb which says “ benî afû Afutsè, bè Afutsè kô lè hû enkweô” to wit “ as a humpback is being buried, another humpback should watch and take note”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We the living are witnesses to what happens after the departed are buried, we know the quarrels, misunderstandings, the fights over property etc on one hand.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, we’ve also seen the unity, love, strong bonding, peace etc that characterized the family of some deceased. Both scenarios are unknown to the deceased!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of this article is to highlight the need to prepare “ our backs” before we exit. Prepare yourself every day since death is sudden and strikes without giving us notice!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Make it a daily routine to always be at peace with all. Avoid contentions and quarrels; be willing to let go no matter what “hurt” or&nbsp; “harm” has been done! In death there is no reconciliation, we reconcile while we live and breathe!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, yes see the offence, hear the lies told, let them shun you ( though they are not in any way better off than you !) in all these turn a blind eye and deaf ears. Always walk away with a smile on your face! Not because, but because!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Always have a clear conscience, and keep your distance lest you contaminate your spirit! After all any meeting with such people is temporary and do not last long.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Use every occasional meeting to demonstrate your peaceful heart /mind and contentment! Enjoy the moment as you focus on positive things that are taking place at the gathering! Laugh if you must, and can till you drop dead!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second lesson we learn is that we,&nbsp; like the dead shall soon be forgotten! We see this a few minutes after the deceased is lowered into the grave and mourners return from the cemetery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The atmosphere changes and it would look like the mourners are saying to themselves “Oh what a good riddance “! Yes, from that very hour, your memory begins to fade!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see this after one year, ask yourself how many return to visit the departed at his “new residence” -the Cemetery? It is declared a “no-go area” to the majority!</p><p>Compare the number of people who were at the funeral to that present at the one-year remembrance!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This should tell the living that they are fading away from people’s memories! The number present at the yearly remembrances dwindles with time ; and so is your memory.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So if you want to know what the state of things would be after you are gone here it is in a summary. If this is what will be, then know how you live.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Enjoy the present, make the most out of every encounter. Avoid the vexations of life, which unfortunately are many. Let me conclude with these admonishments;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>19+ Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, in all things ;&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 13</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Let brotherly love continue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Random thoughts indeed!&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>The Power And Influence Of Music: In Praise Of Singers.&nbsp;</p><p>Revelation 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3+ And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What you’ve read is a very impressive assembly and event that John was privileged to see! I have no time nor interest in the technical discourse or meaning but rather in the literal image and scene.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Not that I can not explain these, any Bible student knows what these represent. I just want to literally enjoy and feel the scene! It is awesome to see. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In any case here is why I quoted the passage. Yesterday we read of the death of a great icon whose music influenced and gave hope, joy and meaning to many a downhearted. Jimmy Cliff was his name.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His songs covered many themes in life, from “ Vietnam”, to Suffering In The Land, To I Can See Clearly Now! Etc. Not forgetting “ you can get it if you really want “ and of course “ the harder they come, the harder the fall “. Yes, this was arguably the best of the singers of his generation! The lyrics of his songs are unsurpassed!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy Cliff blessed our hearts with songs that resonate with human situations! I am reminded of the words in the hymn “Now Praise We Great And Famous Men”. Two verses read ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Praise we the wise and brave and strong,</p><p>Who graced their generation;</p><p>Who helped the right, and fought the wrong,</p><p>And made our folk a nation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 Praise we the great of heart and mind,</p><p>The singers sweetly gifted,</p><p>Whose music like a mighty wind</p><p>The souls of men uplifted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The command to “ speak to one another through songs hymns “ etc cuts across and is not limited to the spiritual but equally to the social settings&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The scripture passages above present us with a pictorial view of a large number assembled to sing.&nbsp; We are told they sang a song that no man knows &nbsp; This probably is a large group of singers and their voices alone can shake a foundation! How I’ll love to hear them sing. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it,&nbsp;</p><p>Revelation 14:3&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[3] And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As stated I&nbsp; am not concerned with the “number” who sang but the fact that they sang a song that no one could learn! What could this song be? We are told. What were the words? We are not told.!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are told of another gathering where they sang the song of Moses and the Lamb! At least it seems here we were given the words of this song&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it&nbsp;</p><p>Revelation 15:3-4&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[3] and sang the song of God's servant Moses and of the Lamb:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Great and marvelous are your deeds, Lord God Almighty. Just and true are your ways, King of the nations.[4] Who will not fear you, Lord, and bring glory to your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous acts have been revealed.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Definitely, He who sits on the throne will enjoy it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have cause to believe that my opening scriptures inspired the popular hymn; On Glorious Summit Stood!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On Zion’s glorious summit stood</p><p>A numerous host redeemed by blood!</p><p>They hymned their King in strains divine;</p><p>I heard the song, and strove to join,</p><p>I heard the song, and strove to join.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Here all who suffered sword or flame</p><p>For truth, or Jesus’ lovely name,</p><p>Shout vict'ry now and hail the Lamb,</p><p>And bow before the great I AM,</p><p>And bow before the great I AM.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3 While everlasting ages roll,</p><p>Eternal love shall feast their soul,</p><p>And scenes of bliss, forever new,</p><p>Rise in succession to their view,</p><p>Rise in succession to their view.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed a favourite of mine. ! Beloved, learn to sing and appreciate songs! The composers have blessed our hearts and lifted our spirits.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share, a tribute to Jimmy Cliff.&nbsp;</p>",

If only! “</p><p>It is not everything that organisers and operators present to us that is genuine !!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a serious note, we are here on a “ sightseeing tour” not every item/agenda etc presented to us is genuine or helpful. Not every account or story we are told is true or accurate, most are embellished exaggerations! Others are outright lies</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We have to examine everything carefully so we do not live to regret later. To recap; not every friend is sincere, not every gift is from a genuine heart, not every invitation is an honour. Not every smile is genuine. Not every handshake or embrace is genuine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just as the Lord discerned and rejected what was presented to Him by the devil even so must we. Do not be misled by the applause if in doubt ask the baby mosquito what her mum told her when she returned from her maiden sightseeing tour.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The baby mosquito misread, mistook etc the effort to kill her when her killers clapped their hands when she passed by them! She thought it was admiration and honour. Not until her mum told her what it meant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is she alone in this? No! Many living today mistake the applause of their disguised enemies to mean endorsements, only to regret it later. &nbsp; It was Wilson Pickett (late) who sang a song titled “ Don’t Let the green grass fool you, don’t let it change your mind “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved when you read the account of the temptation of Jesus as recorded, see it as a “ sightseeing tour” the Devil gave Jesus. The same way he is taking many today on sightseeing!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beware not to be deceived by the niceties of life, nor the admirations of insincere people. They are concealed traps waiting to snap you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A word to the wise</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Could This Be True Of Our Time?</p><p>Jeremiah 31</p><p>KJV</p><p>29+ In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The context of this statement has to do with suffering for the sins of another, a thought that was dominant in Israel at the time. It was a “blame game” statement where succeeding generations blame their predecessors.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though God told the Israelites not to repeat this “ proverb “ anymore but instead focus on how they live since each shall bear the consequences of his wrongs, it can not be denied that the “proverb” originated from the Realities they were experiencing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The opportunities that were missed by previous generations, which imposed untold misery and suffering on them gave birth to what became a “ proverb”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We do or say the same today. Have we not as a church blamed past generations for the sufferings we are experiencing today?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we are finding it difficult to get land to construct meeting places in the cities. Even when we get it, we are unable to buy because of the high cost!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the time when the work began, Land was available and lowly priced in areas which have now developed into cities. Many have accused our forebears of not being proactive, which is the same as saying “ the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children’s teeth are set on edge. “.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Look at the difficulties the majority are going through to purchase land let alone build meeting places. Look at the appeals and the responses. Etc. Are we not repeating the same mistakes we accuse our predecessors of making? We are!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A sad and very disappointing picture we are painting. Surely generations after us will say the same about us, as we see opportunities passing by and we are unable to seize them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what is our hindrance? Is it the lack of funds? Not at all, it is our lack of unity! It is a leadership failure. It is organisational failure!. It is fear! It is a lack of understanding of what we can do as a collective; without violating any biblical principles. The list of what is holding us back is a tall one.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During my active duty, several meetings have been held with the view to finding solutions to this challenge. Agreements, proposals, plans etc were discussed and agreed. What was lacking was implementation!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the secular world this would be described as lacking the “ political will” whereas in the religious, &nbsp; it is the lack of “ spiritual will”. To lack the “ political will” is to be vision-deficient. To lack the “spiritual will” is to lack love for God’s mission/business on Earth. Love-deficient!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember Jesus’ answer to his parents when they came looking for him when he was declared and reported as missing!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it&nbsp;</p><p>Luke 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>49+ And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly his parents, just like us did not understand what he meant by “ my Father’s business!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><p>50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are we missing something here? Why could He not use any other word than “ business “ to describe what He was engaged in? And why did He describe it as “ Father’s Business?”&nbsp;</p><p>Could it be that we’ve not fully studied let alone understood what the Church of God is on Earth? I think we haven’t fully grasped the meaning and purpose. If we do then our approach will not be as it is.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just look at how we approach our personal businesses and compare them with that of the church! Here is where the leadership failure mentioned earlier comes to the fore. If leaders understood the church as the&nbsp; “ Father’s business “ their approach would not be as we see today.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So yes, as we say about our predecessors, the same shall be said of us. , 'The parents have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.'</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To avoid this indictment the solutions lie in collective decision,&nbsp; collective action! A few will have to set the pace ; since we can not get all to see and feel the humiliation that we’ve found ourselves in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There was, is and will always be the “ anti-collectivist” group as was the case in the time of Nehemiah; no matter what we must start from somewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share.

The majority were compelled to learn the hard way, some deliberately, while others did so through circumstances beyond their control.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up, I heard a proverb that stuck with me. It says “If you don’t have a father and by chance you happen to be walking behind a window and hear a father admonishing his son, stop and listen! “&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Eavesdropping” is what this is called, and it is highly recommended for good purposes; the unfortunate thing is majority eavesdrop on bad stories ( toli) instead of the good. I hereby share with you some “eavesdropping” lessons and personal life experiences I gathered!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That things will “fall apart” in life is a certainty, so prepare for it. All will not be rosy in life is an undeniable fact, for every life must of necessity go through turbulences!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Develop and nurture a strong character and mindset that will carry you through the ups and downs. You’ll need these to go through this journey called life. A strong and resilient mindset and spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There will be moments of joy and moments of sorrow, moments of pain and moments of pleasure, cries and laughter! In short, none is immune to the ups and downs associated with life! Just like how not every visitor is welcomed into our lives even so are some encounters we experience in life!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There will be a time when you’ll be relevant and another when you’ll not, know this and learn to live with it when that time comes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re left out of plans, programs and invitations do not complain. Adopt the policy “ if not invited, don’t go”&nbsp; &nbsp;If not told, don’t ask! Here is how you’ll maintain your sanity and peace. It is not every place you must desire to be, and not every thing you should hear or know! Do not attempt to play God! !&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There will be a time when you’ll be loved, and there will be a time when you’ll be despised and hated! The very people who today lay their garments down for you to walk on, are the same people who will pull the same garments from under your feet in the next few years. ! So learn to walk on either red, green or bare floor! Be content in and with whatever situation /circumstance you’ll find yourself in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>( On my occasional morning walks I see some co-walkers, walk barefoot!)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There will be a time when you’ll be surrounded by many, and a time when only a few or none will be with you. So learn and practice how to be lonely! After all, you came alone and will go alone!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Learn not to play to the gallery, for the same gallery that enjoyed your play is the same that will condemn it when they find another player! So, do not trust or relish the applause of the gallery! Loyalty is a prostitute product which is sold and bought! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even scriptures speak to this ;&nbsp;</p><p>Psalms 118</p><p>KJV</p><p>8 It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.9+ It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremiah 17:5&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[5] This is what the Lord says: “Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overly dependence on man is what is meant , this the wise must take to heart when dealing with Man! Do not be pessimistic but be optimistic in life. It is not all about “ pessimism “ but also “ optimism “. Balance.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These I wished I had known earlier! And like the proverb writer said ; the same I say to you who read this article;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>10+ Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A word to the wise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>.</p>",

In trials and temptations, He intervenes by shortening the duration and impact these have on His chosen ones.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, it is a fact that when He pours out His wrath, we, His chosen ones, are not immune; we are equally affected. Take the case of Elijah, when he declared that there would be no rain, this also affected Him!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But true to His Word, He made a way of escape for Elijah &nbsp; Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Kings 17:1-4&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[1] Now Elijah the Tishbite, from Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, “As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[2] Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah: [3] “Leave here, turn eastward and hide in the Kerith Ravine, east of the Jordan</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. [4] You will drink from the brook, and I have directed the ravens to supply you with food there.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lesson is summed up in the words of Paul ;&nbsp;</p><p>Philippians 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, there will be times of “ abundance “ and times of “ need”&nbsp; &nbsp;This was what Elijah learnt through experience and so did the Apostle Paul.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When calamity befalls a nation or a people it affects God’s children also; the only difference is&nbsp; He cushions them! He made birds with little beaks feed Elijah, the question is how much food can they carry with their beaks? But as the saying goes, half a loaf is better than none!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What is more, He made Elijah live on “charity” , none but a widow with little resources was his source of support and sustenance. A situation any once well-to-do person will reject, but not Elijah! &nbsp;The Apostle Paul also lived on charity as he recounted in the following scriptures ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 11:9&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[9] And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way and will continue to do so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, the lesson is clear as a child of God learn to live a humble life so that if it comes to eating garri you’ll eat it joyfully! If it came to receiving help from the ordinary, you’ll do so cheerfully and thankfully.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As was the case with Elijah, the duration of suffering was shortened, yes for the elect’s sake God will do the same for us. Suffering will not be long nor will it last forever! What we need to do is to wait patiently on the Lord!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are not immune to suffering just like the rest of mankind, as Isaiah said we shall walk through fire, rivers and waters just like others; the only difference is He has His Hand on the thermostat&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Isaiah 43</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes for the sake of the Elect, God will make a way for us where there is none! There will be lights off in the Land, but He will let the Moon shine brighter to lighten our homes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He did to Israel when they were in Egypt ;</p><p>Exodus 10</p><p>KJV</p><p>22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:</p><p>23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, the taps may not flow for a time but He will make sure the little we have will take us far if we use it wisely. He will let water come to us from sources we least expect! As He did to Israel in the wilderness and to Elijah the same He will do to us.! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we least expect that’s when He acts so we trust and glorify His Name. What are you going through, it will not last long for the sake of the Elect He will shorten the duration!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a true testimony confirmed by many; beloved your redemption is nearer than you think. Just keep faith in God. Yes after the rain comes the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As was sung by Johnny Nash “ I can see clearly now, the rain is gone ... I can see all obstacles in my way ...

    "text": "<p>Generational Signs To Watch: How We Got To Where We Are Today!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>Kjv</p><p>11<strong>&nbsp;</strong>There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</p><p>12<strong>&nbsp;</strong>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</p><p>13<i>+</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Historians have identified and taught us the causes of the decline and fall of civilisations! They’ve made us understand that it is not external forces (attacks) that bring down societies and, by extension, civilisations, but instead internal rot and decay, especially moral decadence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What you’ve read above is a description of three types of generations, one of which&nbsp;lays the foundation for the other two to build upon.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In one word&nbsp;an Indiscipline generation;&nbsp;A generation&nbsp;that&nbsp;cared less for or about anything! A self-centred generation you may call it and you are right.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read how it is described “There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As stated above the first signs of how societies decay and fall are from the home, it starts from the home.&nbsp;A generation that shows no respect&nbsp;to the elderly,( father /mother)&nbsp;speaks and talks anyhow, a lawless generation is what you see painted by these words.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A generation that sees and regards the elderly as their co-equals. When there is a breakdown of law and order in the home it seeps into society, and gradually like a cancer works it’s way through the fabric of society only to become the norm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a fact that , society’s moral value is the total of individual moralities put together! So, how the home goes so goes society!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next stage of societal decay and collapse is brought about by a stubborn generation; one that would not take no for an answer, wise in their own eyes, thinking and understanding therefore needs no guidance!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A generation that disrespects and disregards established norms, structures and time-tested virtues that hold society together; both morally and spiritually!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our society is at a moral crossroads, and the signs mentioned above are evident, it’s been there for all to see. In every sphere of life, we see these manifesting themselves. In the name of “ liberal democracy”, the foundations have been laid for the destruction of the moral, cultural and spiritual values that once held us together as a people</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People have praised and upheld the country of Singapore as a well-disciplined society, but how they came to be that is unknown to most people! Singaporeans themselves attribute this state of affairs to their founding President Lee Kuan Yew!&nbsp; A strict disciplinarian par excellence!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In short, the value of leadership is what this teaches. Leadership at home, workplace, church etc are key to upholding principles and values! Lead by example is the rule.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 22:6&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>Start children off on the way they should go, and even when they are old they will not turn from it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a bottom-up and not top-down approach; the earlier the training in rightness is started the better and brighter the future looks. This is why we must lay emphasis on early childhood training! As the saying goes “ you can not teach an old dog a new trick”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, a bent-down tree can not be straightened! If you want straighten am Igo Welenga, or sangula ( Rokafil&nbsp; jazz!)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 1:15&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>“What is crooked cannot be straightened; ——“</p><p>If you are now beginning to build a home then take note of these! Lay a strong uncompromising foundation for the next generation you have before you today. You’ll reap what you sow!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These are the Lamentations of an older man as he looks back!&nbsp;</p>",

    "text": "<p>Which Of Us Will Make It?</p><p>Matthew 24:40-42&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[40] Two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. [41] Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; one will be taken and the other left.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[42] “Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From time to time some scriptures do “trouble” my mind one of them is what you’ve read. Two men working in a field, one taken the other left!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two women engaged in a household chore, only for one to be taken, while the other was left behind. This is what we are told it shall be the Day the Lord returns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The question is why is it so? Though we are not told what the reason(s) were we can speculate freely. In my opinion, it has to do simply with “incompatibility! “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The listed persons though engaged in similar activities yet they were not on good terms with each other. A situation similar to what Paul mentioned in a church!&nbsp;</p><p>Philippians 4</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These two sisters of great repute in the local assembly were “ incompatible “ with each other. The Apostle Paul knowing that one Day “ one shall be taken and the other left” asked that they should be assisted to iron out their differences so as to be “ compatible “!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were incompatible on earth which Incompatibility is unacceptable in Heaven! Here are two persons who never lived or strived to be at peace with themselves yet how can they live together peaceably in Heaven? Paul knew what would befall them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Heaven is a place for the “compatibles” so if here on Earth we are “incompatible” with each other such a state of things will not be allowed in Heaven. One of us shall be disqualified! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This explains why one was taken and the other left behind! If I am not on speaking terms with you, how will that change should we be admitted into Heaven?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we don’t get along with each other here on Earth, will that change when we enter Heaven? Will we not continue with it there? In Heaven of all places?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>O please let’s face the facts and be truthful to ourselves! We can not pretend not to know that these exist! Let us help the “Euodias’” and Syntyches’&nbsp; in our local assemblies to be compatible with each other. Else the Day comes when one will be taken and the other left!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Between the two mentioned in the above opening scriptures, God knows the guilty and the innocent. He will therefore take the innocent and leave the guilty. This is what the verses indicate.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>May we remind ourselves of the warning and caution left to us by the Holy Spirit speaking through the Hebrew writer ;&nbsp;</p><p>Hebrews 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>14+ Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may ask but how was this possible? Well, the Judge knew which of the two was innocent! The Judge knew the secrets of our hearts hence the decision to take one and leave the other&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Corinthians 4:5&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[5] Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of the heart. At that time each will receive their praise from God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>16+ In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The truth of a matter may not be known to men ( even if known they may be biased ) so they may ignorantly ( or biased) judge and pronounce in your favor ; but not so with God. Men may judge in your favor, but not God.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is what makes many believe that “ there will be surprises in Heaven!”&nbsp; The innocent here on Earth shall be pronounced guilty and the guilty, innocent on that Day!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For now, some may think they are “innocent” because men said so, but wait to the end!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Are you falsely accused, condemned, etc? Painful as it is, wait patiently; as Paul recommended to the brethren;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Thessalonians 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>7+ And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, two shall be in one congregation, but one shall be taken the other left! Indeed many are called but few shall make it. It is not enough to cry, lord! Lord!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, do not be misled, deceived etc, by the applause and pronouncements of fallible men! Examine your own conscience and be your own judge. Repent and seek reconciliation before that Day comes suddenly on you“ when one shall be taken and the other left “.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do all that is possible while you live and breathe so you’ll be the one to be taken! How sad it would be to be the one to be left after all these years in the church!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read these ;&nbsp;</p><p>1 Peter 3:10-12&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[10] For, “Whoever would love life and see good days must keep their tongue from evil and their lips from deceitful speech. [11] They must turn from evil and do good; they must seek peace and pursue it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[12] For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 12</p><p>KJV</p><p>18+ If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 14</p><p>KJV</p><p>19+ Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 John 1:8&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[8] Watch out that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be rewarded fully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Truths to share with you!

    "text": "<p>The Menace and Havoc Of Human Error.&nbsp;</p><p>Genesis 16:1-2&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[1] Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had borne him no children. But she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar; [2] so she said to Abram, “The Lord has kept me from having children. Go, sleep with my slave; perhaps I can build a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The expression “ human error “ is a “pregnant” expression or an umbrella term that covers almost every mistake made by man. What is of great worry and concern is the consequences that emanate from them&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Middle East conflict that has raged throughout the centuries with no end in sight is one such consequence of “ human error “.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the root of every challenge we face in life is “human error.” Many road accidents, leading to deaths and injuries, have human error as their root cause, expressed in various forms.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But what is human error?&nbsp; It can only be defined by these words: misjudgment, miscalculation, haste, impatience, indiscipline, disobedience, anger, envy, jealousy, greed, selfishness, etc. A tall list that time would not allow.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Almost Everyman born of a woman has had his/her share of “ human error “! Almost everything that has gone wrong with Man is a result of human error!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Death entered the world as a result of “ human error “. Grandpa Adam made a mistake when he ate the forbidden fruit. Grandma Eve made the mistake when she gave Audience to the devil something she should not have done.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of Abraham and Sarai, it was impatience, which is a human error! What about Moses , He could not enter the Promised Land but saw it only from afar because of human error -anger!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What about Cain-and Abel?Human error of envy What about David and Bathsheba? Human error of lack of self-control! What about Paul and Barnabas, what led to their split? Human errors of unforgiveness, anger, nepotism etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The list of “ what about “ is a tall one; you can add yours to it. What is it that has brought suffering to you, is it not misjudgment, impatience, envy, hidden jealousy etc?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, we are all one way or the other victims of human error! No one is exempt not even men of God, both past or present, each has his share of the consequences emanating from human error. Do a critical study of the lives of the men listed (except Jesus ) in the scriptures and you’ll be surprised at the human errors you’ll find. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But can this “deadly disease” called “ human error “ be eradicated? The answer is simply no; it can only be “tamed”! Yes, this is true. Read the confession of one of the most gifted of God’s men, Solomon&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Kings 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>46+ If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did you read that ( there is no man that sinneth not)? &nbsp; Read it again&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 Kings 8:46&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[46] “When they sin against you---for there is no one who does not sin---and you become angry with them and give them over to their enemies, who take them captive to their own lands, far away or near;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hear him again&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 20</p><p>KJV</p><p>9+ Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 7</p><p>KJV</p><p>20+ For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Solomon was as honest as the daylight , he knew firsthand what Paul summarised in these words ;&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is it Solomon alone who made these admissions? Hear James also ;</p><p>James 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>2+ For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>James 3:2&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[2] We all stumble in many ways. Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body in check.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, what about&nbsp; St. John the Divine? Hear him;&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>8+ If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1 John 1</p><p>KJV</p><p>10+ If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, need I say more? Every sin is “ human error “Anything that has gone wrong in our lives be it spiritual or physical is a result of “ human error “None of us is immune.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge therefore is how to bring this “disease” under control since it can not be eradicated! It is this exercise we call “ training in righteousness “ &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Training in “ righteousness “ is an attempt/effort at equipping oneself with the “tools and knowledge” on how to live! We do using as a training manual the Bible. Read what Paul said about this exercise and the manual&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Timothy 3:16-17&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, [17] so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He even commended a young man who was enrolled in this course at an early age , read what he said about this young man&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Timothy 3:14-15&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[14] But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of, because you know those from whom you learned it, [15] and how from infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures, which can make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Timothy enrolled in level 100 and started taking the course at an early stage in life. No wonder he graduated first class and had good commendation</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read it ;</p><p>Acts 16:1-2&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[1] Paul came to Derbe and then to Lystra, where a disciple named Timothy lived, whose mother was Jewish and a believer but whose father was a Greek. [2] The believers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dearly beloved, we all suffer from the consequences of the disease&nbsp; &nbsp;“ Human Error” the more the “ error “ the worse our lives are, the lesser the better. But it can only be less if we take the course “ training in righteousness “ seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maturity. is a step we must climb one can not run or jump over these steps.! There is always the “ add unto “ as Peter said ;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Peter 1:5,8,10-11&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[5] For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge; [8] For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[10] Therefore, my brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[11] and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dearly beloved, work hard to bring your “human error” index low. It is possible! We are all “works in progress” none is fully complete.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Major thoughts to share.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

What a man sows, the same he reaps, trees produce after their kind, What we do to others shall be done to us etc etc what goes around, comes around! These are just a few&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The same law of reciprocity applies concerning our spiritual lives, that we are blessed to bless, comforted to comfort, saved to save, and delivered to deliver. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of what status or position we hold in life we are duty-bound to reciprocate! For example, God blesses us and we in return bless Him. The Mighty blesses the Lesser and the Lesser also blesses the Mighty &nbsp; This Law applies to all and sundry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take the example of blessing, most are ignorant of the fact that this law applies to blessings also , we’ve always held the belief that only God can bless forgetting that we can and must also bless Him &nbsp; Read these few verses ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psalms 103</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.</p><p>2+ Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Psalms 103</p><p>KJV</p><p>22+ Bless the Lord, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we give back to God what He gave us, we are blessing Him. When we return to Him the praises He heaped on us, we are blessing Him &nbsp; When we return to Him whatever He gave or do for us, we are fulfilling the Law of reciprocity</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is how we are kept in sync and in fellowship with God.

With age comes wisdom. With age comes refinement! These are profound observations that most treat with disbelief and contempt.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I was young many who knew me will attest that I was a “ revolutionary “ ( and still am!) par excellence &nbsp; I always have ready-made answers to every/any question and they are the right answers!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(We call this “ the ability to think on one's feet” and it’'s a gift perfected through studies and practice! )</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am not blowing my “horns”, nor “trumpets” or “xylophones” ( whichever ) a fact is a fact. Yes, scriptures say let someone “ blow your horn “ yet the lizard nods his head in appreciation of himself after landing safely from a fall from a height. Is he wrong? Not all.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Understand my “ horn and trumpet “ in the context of what you are about to read!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is nothing wrong or sinful in answering questions as I did then, what was lacking then was “discernment”! Some questions are better left unanswered than answered.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From hindsight, I made many mistakes the consequences I am living with today. I made more enemies than friends because where I should have kept quiet I spoke. Questions I should have ignored I answered. I thought then that all men love to be told the truth. How naïve I was! The passage of years and experience has taught me that I was wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I ignored and disobeyed the “ law of seasons” with damning consequences. Read this law;&nbsp;</p><p>Ecclesiastes 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>7+ A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is called “ the law of seasons “ learn and obey it else!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life has taught me much, which led me to understand and adopt the philosophy; “In the midst of fools it is foolishness to be wise !”&nbsp; Something Jesus exemplified when he appeared before the Sanhedrin Read it,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 26</p><p>KJV</p><p>61+ And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days</p><p>.</p><p>62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? What is it which these witness against thee?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>63+ But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The only time He opened His mouth was when Pilate acted ignorantly, as a show of power/authority Read it&nbsp;</p><p>John 19</p><p>KJV</p><p>8 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</p><p>9+ And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>10 Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>11+ Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, this tells you that not every question deserves to be answered. Sometimes it is better to leave an ignorant person in his ignorance than to try to teach him!&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 26</p><p>KJV</p><p>4+ Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus held His quiet because when he assessed the audience it would be foolhardy to try to answer them. Please learn to do the same!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Did Paul not give similar advice? Read it ;</p><p>2 Timothy 2</p><p>KJV</p><p>23+ But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, questions fall into two categories, “foolish and unlearned.”&nbsp; Know these, identify and categorise questions to decide whether to answer or not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Foolish questions” are mostly emotional in content, context and presentation! Know this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Unlearned questions “ are mostly questions lacking in facts, coming from a “half-baked” egoistic, playing to the gallery type of persons. Know this also&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus refused to answer non-factual questions ( lies)! To Him, it would be a waste of time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 26:60-61,63&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[60] But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally, two came forward [61] and declared, “This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.' ”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[63] But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, “I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dearly beloved it is not every question you need to or must answer! Even in examinations we are told “ do not answer all questions “. Answer two or three, so even though you could answer all five or six you are told to answer three.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So you hear but you haven’t heard, you see but you haven’t seen; this is wisdom at its best. This is maturity. A wise man does not seek to justify himself by answering every question , his silence justifies and answers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, a word to the wise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

They say unto him, We are able.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, life presents us with many and diverse “ cups” to drink from; some large, medium others small sizes&nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever size it is, it is a “ cup” that can not be avoided&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these “ cups” are emotional distress, illnesses, business challenges, financial difficulties, home and marital, relational incompatibilities, betrayals, disloyalties etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>None of these “cups” tastes sweet but bitter, like Jesus we all pray either audibly or silently “ let this cup pass from me “. &nbsp; As we read he concluded by saying “</p><p>nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, some “ cups” we can drink, others we can not. There are some difficulties and challenges we can either overcome or endure others we can not.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It gets to a point in life where you just have to resign your will and accept the inevitable. by preparing the mind to live with it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jesus prayed 3 times for the “ cup” to pass from Him but it was not to be, so he gave up to accept the inevitable &nbsp; There comes a time when you must also resign and give in.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is easier said than done , here is where the difficulty lies. How do we know we have come to the end of the road? How do we know it is time to give in?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved there is no easy formula except to discern through prayer and observation, the signs of the times &nbsp; For example Jesus gave in when he observed the attitude of those He thought he could rely on. Please pay attention to these as I trace from the events in the garden&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read the developments&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 26:38&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[38] Then he said to them, “My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He took with Him trusted , and loyal friends to the garden. He had earlier told them about the “ Cup”.and for which reason He brought them to the garden. So they knew why they were there with him. To lend support.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He then asked them to “ Stay here and keep watch with me.”! Unfortunately, this was not to be. Read the next discouraging experience, the first sign, you should watch ;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 26:40&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[40] Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. “Couldn't you men keep watch with me for one hour?” he asked Peter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was a rhetorical question of disappointment! As if this was the end to the disappointment; it occurred again ;</p><p>Matthew 26:43</p><p>NIV</p><p>[43] When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, when those you thought you could rely on become occupied with their own interests, as&nbsp; indicated above by these words “ their eyes were heavy “ then know the “cup” was meant for you&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He left them went and came back again hoping to find them on their knees only to be sadly disappointed again&nbsp; &nbsp;Read it&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 26:45&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[45] Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour has come, and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, they were not only “ sleeping” but also “ resting “ which words paint pictures of different scenarios! To sleep is one thing to rest&nbsp;is another.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were simply chatting discussing probably their own affairs which had nothing to do with Jesus and why they were in the garden.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, when you see these attitudes among those you think will rally behind you, then know it is a “ cup” that you must drink! Resign your will and accept the inevitable. This is exactly what Jesus did!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, yes while you may pray “ let this cup pass from me “ also add “ nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.”&nbsp; and preiare your spirit and mind to endure the discomfort.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll know it is His will that you drink of the “ cup” when friends and family desert you!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An experience to share with you! A word to the wise!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Oh oh oh. Hum! Time O time how I wished you would never move forward!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, we changed the lesson as soon as we heard the bell.

There is a time to be sad. And there's a time to dance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After reading my post titled ” change lesson please!” someone asked if I could write on the last announcement ” closing please!” I said, why not! Here is what ”closing please” reminded me of my School days!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We normally close school with lots of homework assigned to us; the last period was used for copying them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because we had to join buses at the main Accra Central Bus Terminus, opposite the Opera Cinema (1964), some hurriedly copied without paying attention to what they were copying.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The next day many get caned for mistakes made simply because they did not pay attention to what they were copying.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This reminded me of how many of us shall be disqualified from receiving our rewards at the close of life’s journey because we were in a hurry and therefore paid no attention to what we are assigned to do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At the last hour when the bell boy shall announce “ closing please “ or “ stop work please “ this can be likened to what the Lord said, this closing please shall be announced by Angels.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 24</p><p>KJV</p><p>31+ And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We shall all line up to present our work to the Teacher for marking as is normally the case at school. In my school, results are often announced and commendations made &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those who did well are clapped for and those who didn’t are hooted at. In some cases, they are made to scrub the stinking school urinals ( washrooms you call them today !)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here is how ours will look when the bell boy ( Angels) announces “ closing please “.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 25:31-38,40 NIV</p><p>[31] “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.

    "text": "<p>Fear Is Natural, Know How To Live With It.&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 30</p><p>KJV</p><p>8+ Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most often ignored subject but real among men is the subject of Fear, it is assumed but not expressed!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fear is “feared” so much so that we are afraid to talk about “him”! Fear is a despot and a tyrant that has ruled mankind since the Creation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It has been the major cause of the failure of many a life. It shattered dreams, dimmed hopes, and rendered lives clueless and unenjoyable</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is a hidden spirit that lives in every man from Adam to John Tamakloe, it will continue to live till the last trumpet shall sound and time shall be no more.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As long as time and Man exist, fear also lives. Fear therefore is a natural phenomenon that we can not do without&nbsp; &nbsp;Almost every man listed in the Bible experienced its effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cain feared losing face so he killed his brother. Abraham feared death, so he told Abimelech that Sara was his sister. The list of men of God who feared “fear” (!?) is a tall one. None is exempt! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So don’t be afraid to “fear”, you are not the first nor the last, everyone has something he/she fears. What you’ve read as the verse for discussion is David’s expression of his fears Both great and small, all do have fears.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In life there are three main situations or circumstances that we all fear, these are Death, Poverty and Sickness; all others are subservient and minor.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Death, poverty and sickness stood out in a “universal opinion poll” as the topmost that humanity fears. If in doubt conduct your own, ask yourself privately and in the quiet what do I fear? You’ll be surprised that these three will emerge as the topmost.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>David had his fears as expressed in the verse you’ve read. “Do not make me rich or poor else there will be dire consequences that I cannot stand.” By these words, he is saying “I am afraid of extremities!”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was in my first year in College, that I was introduced to Jeremy Bentham the “father” of the philosophy known as “ utilitarianism “</p><p>( John Locke, John Stuart Mills, etc also wrote on this subject ) &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of his famous quotes that has remained etched on my mind over the years reads;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the one hand the standard of right and wrong, on the other the chain of causes and effects, are fastened to their throne”</p><p>( Unquote) .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh mine! What a truth! Two “sovereign masters” rule our lives they are called “ pain and “ pleasure “. These two are the determinants, they decide what we do and or do not do.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed everything we do in life is to avoid or minimise “pain” and increase “pleasure”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, to avoid the pain associated with walking long distances we ride in a car. To avoid the stress associated with fanning a coal pot fire we buy and use gas or electric-powered stoves.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, the Fear of “ pain” drives us to work and buy items of comfort and pleasure.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Death, poverty and sickness are what we feared most! Of the three Death is inevitable but still we can do something about it humanly speaking!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, I am sure you are surprised to read this! Remember I said “ humanly “ speaking. What then can we do will be your next question!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you care to know we can “ postpone “its arrival date! Oh yes! The majority including you does it almost every day just that you don’t realise it!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we are sick don’t we visit hospitals? What do we go there to do? Why not stay at home to submit or succumb to the disease and die?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember sicknesses are indications that the body has deviated from its normal natural ranges or parameters and needs “ resetting”.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Something is out of setting and until it is reseted death will follow. Any time you attend a hospital, take a tablet etc ; you are postponing death’s arrival time. You are attempting to reset the body.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Medicines,&nbsp; medications, surgeries etc are deployed to reset the human parts that have gone out of their natural or original state. . All these efforts are meant to “ postpone “ or “ delay “ death.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the spiritual realm, intercessory prayers are made, seeking divine “ postponement “ the certainty of which is beyond human control.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This belief and approach is based on the fact that God “postponed” someone’s death at His will and wish. If he did it to someone, then He can do it again. Here the reference is to King Hezekiah. (2 Kings 20)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Death and sickness are “distant cousins” , if sickness is well handled/managed “he” keeps “his” distant cousin, death away for a while. Know this so you can prolong your life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The paracetamols we take are all temporary “&nbsp; death and sickness postponing “ measures ! If you fail to take them sickness will visit, take and hand you over to Death. Now you know.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally what about “ poverty “? The fear of poverty is equally universal just like death and sickness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, we can live with it if we know its secrets and how it operates. Read it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Poverty has many “friends” one of its best friends is called “lazy” but because they afflict many it is called “ laziness “🤣</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you unknowingly take him as a friend he will introduce you automatically to “Poverty” and his other friends; namely “comfort” and “procrastination”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Read the observation of one man!&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 24:30-31,33-34&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[30] I went past the field of a sluggard, past the vineyard of someone who has no sense; [31] thorns had come up everywhere, the ground was covered with weeds, and the stone wall was in ruins</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. [33] A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest--- [34] and poverty will come on you like a thief and scarcity like an armed man.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, yes though poverty is one of the three most feared yet like the other two, it can be managed or contained. If we can identify and avoid “his” friends as listed above so be it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, death, sickness and poverty are most feared yet we can live with them if we know how. Read over what you’ve just read to remember how to live with them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Though they are inevitable do not let them overcome you, overcome them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A thought to share! A word to a right-thinking person is both an investment and a seed!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Proverbs 9:9&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>Instruct the wise and they will be wiser still; teach the righteous and they will add to their learning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

It struck me that we’ve also rented “ canopies “ which will one day be dismantled!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our bodies are “ canopies “ we’ve rented for use, the Owner will soon send His dismantling squad to take them away. Our rental agreements contain expiry dates so enjoy the duration you have the “ canopy”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who the Dismantling squads are I’ve identified and mentioned to the majority when I preached at funerals; so I need not repeat! Death itself is one!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just remember no matter how you decorate it, no matter how much time and money you spend on it when the expiry date comes your canopy will be dismantled! Pray that the “ squad” will do the dismantling gradually and gently not violently!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joe Atiso, a very popular singer with the Ramblers International Dance Band (1960s-1970s) sang a song in Ewe “ alô mè manô ku navà wum “ ( I’ll die in my sleep ) &nbsp; My generation will remember those days !!! Yes, when boys were boys! Where were you !! Hmm!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed how nice and beautiful some of the canopies looked but were dismantled! Some of the items that made them beautiful were pulled apart;&nbsp; destroying them completely! I recognised that the same shall be done to our “ canopies “ when we die.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The dust shall return dust, ashes to Ashes. The canopy was made from the earth and to the earth it shall return! The occupant which is a spirit shall return to where it came to be assessed ( judge) and relocated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, this does not mean you shouldn’t maintain ( dress and decorate ) your canopy, no please do, keep it up to date so it can serve you for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When our “festive season” here on Earth is over, the earthly Canopy shall be dismantled , interestingly and thankfully there is a promise of another canopy elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just that this new canopy will be made available to those who used the first earthly one properly and profitably. Those who obeyed and followed the rental rules attached to it by the Owner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many we are told looked up to that new canopy so they conducted and comported themselves very well, as a result they received high commendations from the Rental Company owner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 10</p><p>KJV</p><p>32+ Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Revelation 3</p><p>KJV</p><p>5+ He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Oh, how we look forward to that day when upon the commendation of Jesus we shall be given new canopies! Canopies that can not be dismantled, they are eternal.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Resolve to take good care of the present canopy you’ve rented. It is temporal expect a &nbsp; better one.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts as I watched the dismantling of festive canopies and paraphernalia.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 5:1&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[1] For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands.</p>",

    "text": "<p>The Adventures Of One Man!</p><p>Romans 5</p><p>KJV</p><p>12+ Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This verse has been subjected to many interpretations with to proving that modern man is not responsible for his sins! That Adams should be blamed because it was his action /sin that spilt over.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tje Truth Of The matter is, yes we did not sin so we are not guilty but the consequences of Adam’s sin, which is death is what we have inherited.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And it was this very reason that one man also came into the world to deliver us from this very consequence.&nbsp;</p><p>Read</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Romans 5:15,17-19&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[15] But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[17] For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[18] Consequently, just as one trespass resulted in condemnation for all people, so also one righteous act resulted in justification and life for all people.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[19] For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So you see, one man through disobedience brought death, another through obedience brought life, it’s always a matter of choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We see this in history either as a nation, family, church or community. One man’s adventure can result in a good or bad outcome, which can influence future generations&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Europe came into contact with Africa not as an official policy but through the adventures of individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Portugal came into contact with the Gold Coast through the adventures of an individual “ Don Diego de Azambuja”. A name I nearly adopted as a “nickname “when I was in primary school just because it sounded nice in my ears! Hmmm.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>British interest and influence in the Gold Coast was not through official channels but through the adventures of an individual Captain George Maclean.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trace the history of all the external contacts Africa has with Europe and you’ll be amazed at how these came through the adventures of individuals&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Names like Mungo Park, David Livingstone, Vasco Da Gama, Christopher Columbus etc all point to the role individuals played in linking civilisations together.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But you may be wondering why all these “ discourse ?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is to make the point that history is about individuals and not a collective. Collectives don’t make history it is individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Committees/commissions etc; don’t make history it is individuals, they only help or assist an individual whose name at the end of the day is attached to the Report.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve heard of the 1948 Watson Commission Report. The justice Ollenu Commission Report, Justice Archer Commission Report, justice VCRAC Crabbe Report, Emile Short Report etc&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to the church of Christ Ghana, one individual stands tall as the one whose singular effort to know and practice the truth has resulted in the thousands of churches of Christ we see in Ghana today!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John Gaido is the name. So when you lift your hands in praise of God, if you beat your chest because you know the truth, do not forget the individual through whom God made this possible.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whether we like it or not we cannot deny the role and place of John Gaido in the history of the churches of Christ, Ghana. His singular effort is what has brought us this far.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, history is not made by a collective but by an individual! What is there to be credited to your name?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In political discourse and governance ; you hear more of the “ Nkrumah administration “ the Busia Administration, Limann, Rawlings, Mills, Mahama, Akkufo Addo administrations. Very little almost forgotten collective administrations such as the NLC, SMC, PNDC!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>History is made by individuals and not a collective. Individuals are remembered not a collective.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I watch the growth and spread of the churches of Christ these thoughts flowed through my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Those of us who are drinking from Wells we never dug, should not forget those who dug them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If today you are leading a nation, group, family, congregation etc that you were never a part of it’s established, do not forget those who laid down their lives, time, talent, resources etc to bring it into existence&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Church of Christ, Ghana owes a lot to an individual-John Gaido!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts as usual to share. From one man’s spiritual adventure has resulted the salvation of the many! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

There have been many hurts just as there have been few healings. There have been great losses as there have been few gains!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through all these “ups” and “downs” both His fiery and cloudy pillars have seen us through successfully! Where there is a will, there will always be a way!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Beloved, as we stand today at the banks of our “Jordan” ready to cross, let us resolve to put away all that pollutes and contaminates both the mind and the spirit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2 Corinthians 7</p><p>KJV</p><p>1+ Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A new beginning is about to dawn on us, unworthy as we are yet His Grace is sufficient for us. Let us acknowledge that “we are who we are because of who He is! “Let us therefore live to reflect His image through us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He is the Light that shines through us so those in darkness can see. This is a charge He gave us!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Matthew 5:16&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[16] In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let the coming year be a year of good deeds! Let it be a year of service to humanity! Let it be a year of reconciliation among factions. Let it be a year of teamwork/spirit &nbsp; Let it be a year of goodwill towards all men!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>. Hebrews 12:14</p><p>NIV</p><p>[14] Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Identify and avoid relationships that will provoke and be vexations to your spirit! Remember, to owe no man anything except the debt of love. Do not attempt to please all men , this is an impossible task!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do what you can, with what you have, at where you are Nothing more nothing less; it is for these you’ll give an account.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Spend today in the quietness of your heart to reflect on the past. The countdown has begun, and soon we shall by His Grace enter into the promised year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Do not panic or be anxious, just standstill to see the salvation of the Lord!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts to share&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Uncertainties galore is how someone described it!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How we start a race is equally important as how we end it. With tact and planning a race may not pose a challenge that can not be overcome if proper planning precedes it. So these few “ hours “ of the year are the time to do exactly that. Spend time to think through, pray, consult, talk to the spiritually minded , tap into their wisdom etc&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat at home throughout yesterday thinking and praying seeking “guidance” and “direction”. Some called to ask what my thoughts and plans are for the year. I told them “ I am waiting for direction, it has not yet come!” They asked “From whom?” I said “ from above !”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Hebrew writer says “Let us run with patience the race that is set before us,” In like manner let us begin the year with patience, and not be in a hurry.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us “ walk “ in the first few days of the month feeling and fashioning our ways and plans! Let us hasten, yes but “hasten slowly”! Run, yes but “ run with patience“</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Use the few days to “ walk “ around and make sure you are certain, before you begin the race! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A “race” of 365 days, which translates into 8,760 hours surely must be undertaken with proper planning. A well-thought-out strategy is required else one will give up midway.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So the advice and admonition is “ run with patience” the race that lies ahead of you. Pay attention to details, exercise extreme caution when dealing with people. Physical and spiritual scammers will display their “wares” &nbsp;so be careful and vigilant &nbsp; You’ve heard of the expression “ buyer beware”!&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even as I write some “scammers” are at work trying to “scam” me by creating the impression that a fault I have is difficult and can not be resolved quickly and easily.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I grant them their ignorance, they don’t know that they are talking to an engineer, who knows what the problem is but has called them out because the State required that he does so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Be vigilant and wise both physically and spiritually , the race has just begun!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My thoughts to share&nbsp;</p>",

He had to go to the wilderness, to observe and encounter the Divine through the “ burning bush” incident. His preparation began there.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take the case of Joseph, he has to go through the course of how to manage rejection, by being thrown into a well, then brought out only to be sold into slavery by no stranger but his own brothers. Yes!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What about Paul&nbsp; read his own account of his “ waiting and preparation time “&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Galatians 1:15-18&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[15] But when God, who set me apart from my mother's womb and called me by his grace, was pleased [16] to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult any human being.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[17] I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[18] Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Have you ever asked why he went into Arabia, ? What was he there for? As he said, he could have gone to see the apostles to receive&nbsp; “appô, instructions and guidance “ but he said no I didn’t!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We can only surmise that he was in Arabia, where he underwent preparation and orientation after which he returned to Damascus!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll recall he was on his way to Damascus when he was converted &nbsp; Read it;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Acts 22:5-6,11</p><p>NIV</p><p>[5] as the high priest and all the Council can themselves testify. I even obtained letters from them to their associates in Damascus, and went there to bring these people as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[6] “About noon as I came near Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>[11] My companions led me by the hand into Damascus, because the brilliance of the light had blinded me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So you now know the meaning of what he said “ later I returned to Damascus “</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“I did not go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was, but I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I can cite many examples of how many began their walk with God. Even Jesus had to go to the wilderness! What He went through that we label “ temptation by the devil” was actually part of the course He must take. It was part of His level 101 course.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve said all these things to make the case that the first few months of the year will be our “preparation time”. God intend to do great things for and with you! He must first prepare you so whatever befalls or comes your way, know that it is part of the “waiting” course.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There will be your “ burning bush”, betrayals, trials and temptations, etc period and experience; in all these know that you are being prepared for a greater assignment&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just as Moses, Joseph, Paul etc graduated and became who they are, even so you’ll be if you remain steadfast! Remember none of what they went through lasted forever!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just know that there will be periods of inconvenience which is what they experienced. Always repeat ;</p><p>Romans 8</p><p>KJV</p><p>31+ What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And do remember His promise and assurance,</p><p>Isaiah 43:2&nbsp;</p><p>NIV</p><p>[2] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t say I never told you. Thoughts to share!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
